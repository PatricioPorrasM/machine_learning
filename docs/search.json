Variables como la humedad, la temperatura y la radiación solar suelen ser determinantes en los procesos de precipitación, lo que se refleja en la magnitud y el signo de sus coeficientes.\nEn conclusión, el modelo es una herramienta útil para estimar la precipitación a partir de datos meteorológicos, aunque su precisión depende de la calidad y representatividad de los datos. Se recomienda complementar este análisis con modelos más complejos o incorporar más datos para mejorar la capacidad predictiva si es necesario.",

Missing data can bias analysis or break downstream models if not handled properly.\n\nDetect patterns in missingness\nIdentify if some columns are almost entirely null\nDecide whether to drop or impute certain variables\n\n\n\nLet’s start by computing the percentage of missing values in each column:\n\n\nCode\nnan_percent = movies.isna().mean() * 100\nnan_percent_sorted = nan_percent.sort_values(ascending=False).round(2)\nnan_percent_sorted\n\n\nUS_DVD_Sales              82.38\nRunning_Time_min          62.23\nDirector                  41.58\nRotten_Tomatoes_Rating    27.49\nMPAA_Rating               18.90\nCreative_Type             13.93\nSource                    11.40\nMajor_Genre                8.59\nDistributor                7.25\nIMDB_Rating                6.65\nIMDB_Votes                 6.65\nUS_Gross                   0.22\nWorldwide_Gross            0.22\nTitle                      0.03\nProduction_Budget          0.03\nRelease_Date               0.00\ndtype: float64\n\n\n\n\n\nTo visualize missing values with Altair, we need to reshape the data into a long format where each missing value is a row:\n\n\nCode\nmovies_nans = movies.isna().reset_index().melt(\n    id_vars='index',\n    var_name='column',\n    value_name=\"NaN\"\n)\nmovies_nans\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nindex\ncolumn\nNaN\n\n\n\n\n0\n0\nTitle\nFalse\n\n\n1\n1\nTitle\nFalse\n\n\n2\n2\nTitle\nFalse\n\n\n3\n3\nTitle\nFalse\n\n\n4\n4\nTitle\nFalse\n\n\n...\n...\n...\n...\n\n\n51211\n3196\nIMDB_Votes\nFalse\n\n\n51212\n3197\nIMDB_Votes\nTrue\n\n\n51213\n3198\nIMDB_Votes\nFalse\n\n\n51214\n3199\nIMDB_Votes\nFalse\n\n\n51215\n3200\nIMDB_Votes\nFalse\n\n\n\n\n51216 rows × 3 columns\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis heatmap shows where missing values occur across rows and columns. Patterns may indicate:\n\nColumns with consistently missing values\nEntire rows with large gaps\nCorrelated missingness between variables\n\nTo avoid limitations in the number of rows rendered by Altair, we disable the max rows warning:\n\n\nCode\nalt.data_transformers.disable_max_rows()\n\n\nDataTransformerRegistry.enable('default')\n\n\nNow we can create the heatmap:\n\n\nCode\nalt.Chart(movies_nans).mark_rect().encode(\n    alt.X('index:O'),\n    alt.Y('column'),\n    alt.Color('NaN')\n).properties(\n    width=1000\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis plot can help identify columns or rows with critical data issues.\n\n\n\nIn many real-world cases, we may decide to remove columns that have too many missing values. Let’s set a threshold of 70%:\n\n\nCode\nthreshold_nan = 70 # in percent\ncols_to_drop = nan_percent[nan_percent&gt;threshold_nan].index\ncols_to_drop\n\n\nIndex(['US_DVD_Sales'], dtype='object')\n\n\nThese columns have more than 70% missing values and may not be useful for analysis.\n\n\n\n\nFinally, we drop the selected columns and inspect the updated dataset:\n\n\nCode\nmovies_cleaned = movies.drop(columns=cols_to_drop)\nmovies_cleaned\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle\nUS_Gross\nWorldwide_Gross\nProduction_Budget\nRelease_Date\nMPAA_Rating\nRunning_Time_min\nDistributor\nSource\nMajor_Genre\nCreative_Type\nDirector\nRotten_Tomatoes_Rating\nIMDB_Rating\nIMDB_Votes\n\n\n\n\n0\nThe Land Girls\n146083.0\n146083.0\n8000000.0\nJun 12 1998\nR\nNaN\nGramercy\nNone\nNone\nNone\nNone\nNaN\n6.1\n1071.0\n\n\n1\nFirst Love, Last Rites\n10876.0\n10876.0\n300000.0\nAug 07 1998\nR\nNaN\nStrand\nNone\nDrama\nNone\nNone\nNaN\n6.9\n207.0\n\n\n2\nI Married a Strange Person\n203134.0\n203134.0\n250000.0\nAug 28 1998\nNone\nNaN\nLionsgate\nNone\nComedy\nNone\nNone\nNaN\n6.8\n865.0\n\n\n3\nLet's Talk About Sex\n373615.0\n373615.0\n300000.0\nSep 11 1998\nNone\nNaN\nFine Line\nNone\nComedy\nNone\nNone\n13.0\nNaN\nNaN\n\n\n4\nSlam\n1009819.0\n1087521.0\n1000000.0\nOct 09 1998\nR\nNaN\nTrimark\nOriginal Screenplay\nDrama\nContemporary Fiction\nNone\n62.0\n3.4\n165.0\n\n\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n\n\n3196\nZack and Miri Make a Porno\n31452765.0\n36851125.0\n24000000.0\nOct 31 2008\nR\n101.0\nWeinstein Co.\nOriginal Screenplay\nComedy\nContemporary Fiction\nKevin Smith\n65.0\n7.0\n55687.0\n\n\n3197\nZodiac\n33080084.0\n83080084.0\n85000000.0\nMar 02 2007\nR\n157.0\nParamount Pictures\nBased on Book/Short Story\nThriller/Suspense\nDramatization\nDavid Fincher\n89.0\nNaN\nNaN\n\n\n3198\nZoom\n11989328.0\n12506188.0\n35000000.0\nAug 11 2006\nPG\nNaN\nSony Pictures\nBased on Comic/Graphic Novel\nAdventure\nSuper Hero\nPeter Hewitt\n3.0\n3.4\n7424.0\n\n\n3199\nThe Legend of Zorro\n45575336.0\n141475336.0\n80000000.0\nOct 28 2005\nPG\n129.0\nSony Pictures\nRemake\nAdventure\nHistorical Fiction\nMartin Campbell\n26.0\n5.7\n21161.0\n\n\n3200\nThe Mask of Zorro\n93828745.0\n233700000.0\n65000000.0\nJul 17 1998\nPG-13\n136.0\nSony Pictures\nRemake\nAdventure\nHistorical Fiction\nMartin Campbell\n82.0\n6.7\n4789.0\n\n\n\n\n3201 rows × 15 columns",

    "section": "2.1 Univariate Analysis: Quantitative",
    "text": "2.1 Univariate Analysis: Quantitative\nA univariate analysis focuses on examining a single numeric variable to understand its distribution, shape, central tendency, and spread. One of the most common tools for this is the histogram.\nIn this case, we’ll explore the distribution of the movie runtime (Running_Time_min).\n\n2.1.1 Basic Histogram\nWe start by creating a histogram to visualize the distribution of running times:\n\n\nCode\nalt.Chart(movies_cleaned).mark_bar().encode(\n    alt.X('Running_Time_min',bin=alt.Bin(maxbins=30)),\n    alt.Y('count()')\n).properties(\n    title='Histogram of Movie Runtimes (30 bins)'\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis chart shows how many movies fall into each time interval (bin). However, histograms can look quite different depending on the number and size of bins used.\n\n\n2.1.2 Effect of Bin Size\nLet’s compare how the histogram shape changes with different bin sizes:\n\n\nCode\nhistogram_1 = alt.Chart(movies_cleaned).mark_bar().encode(\n    alt.X('Running_Time_min',bin=alt.Bin(maxbins=8)),\n    alt.Y('count()')\n)\n\nhistogram_2 = alt.Chart(movies_cleaned).mark_bar().encode(\n    alt.X('Running_Time_min',bin=alt.Bin(maxbins=10)),\n    alt.Y('count()')\n)\n\nhistogram_1 | histogram_2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEven though both plots use the same data, the choice of bin size changes the visual interpretation. A small number of bins may hide details, while too many bins can make it harder to spot trends.\n\n\n2.1.3 Density plots, or Kernel Density Estimate (KDE)\nDensity plots offer a smoothed alternative to histograms. Instead of using rectangular bins to count data points, they estimate the probability density function by placing bell-shaped curves (kernels) at each observation and summing them.\nThis approach helps reduce the visual noise and jaggedness that can occur in histograms and gives a clearer picture of the underlying distribution.\n\n\nCode\nalt.Chart(movies_cleaned).transform_density(\n    'Running_Time_min',\n    as_=['Running_Time_min','density'],\n).mark_area().encode(\n    alt.X('Running_Time_min'),\n    alt.Y('density:Q')\n).properties(\n    title=\"Movies runtime\"\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.4 Grouped Density plot\nWe can also compare distributions across groups by splitting the KDE by a categorical variable using the groupby parameter. This helps us see how the distribution differs between categories, such as genres.\n\n\nCode\nselection = alt.selection_point(fields=['Major_Genre'], bind='legend')\n\nalt.Chart(movies_cleaned).transform_density(\n    'Running_Time_min',\n    groupby=['Major_Genre'],\n    as_=['Running_Time_min', 'density'],\n).mark_area(opacity=0.5).encode(\n    alt.X('Running_Time_min'),\n    alt.Y('density:Q', stack=None),\n    alt.Color('Major_Genre'),\n    opacity=alt.condition(selection, \n        alt.value(1), \n        alt.value(0.05)\n    )\n).add_params(\n    selection\n).properties(\n    title=\"Movies Runtime by Genre (Interactive Filter)\"\n).interactive()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe transparency (opacity=0.5) allows us to observe overlapping distributions and ensures that small density areas are not completely hidden behind larger ones.\nFrom this plot, we can observe, for example, that Drama movies have runtimes nearly as long as the longest Adventure movies, even though their overall distributions differ.",

    "text": "2.2 Bivariate Analysis: Categorical vs Quantitative\nBivariate analysis examines the relationship between two variables. In this case, we focus on one categorical variable (e.g., genre) and one quantitative variable (e.g., revenue), which is a very common scenario in exploratory data analysis.\nThis type of analysis is useful to: - Compare average or median values across categories. - Detect outliers or high-variance groups. - Understand distributional differences across categories.\nBelow are several effective visualizations for this analysis.\n\n2.2.1 Basic Barchart\nBar charts are effective for comparing aggregated values (like the mean) across different groups. However, they hide the distribution and variation within each group.\n\n\nCode\nalt.Chart(movies_cleaned).mark_bar().encode(\n    alt.X('mean(Worldwide_Gross)'),\n    alt.Y(\"Major_Genre\")\n).properties(\n    title=\"Average Worldwide Gross by Genre\"\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis bar chart shows the mean Worldwide Gross per genre. It is useful for identifying which genres are more profitable on average, but does not show how spread out the data is.\n\n\n2.2.2 Tick Plot\nTo visualize individual data points, we use a tick plot. This helps uncover variability within genres and detect outliers.\n\n\nCode\nalt.Chart(movies_cleaned).mark_tick().encode(\n    alt.X('Worldwide_Gross'),\n    alt.Y(\"Major_Genre\"),\n    alt.Tooltip('Title:N')\n).properties(\n    title=\"Individual Gross per Movie by Genre\"\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.3 Heatmaps\nHeatmaps can summarize the frequency of data points across both axes (quantitative and categorical) using color intensity. It’s particularly useful for spotting patterns without getting overwhelmed by individual points.\n\n\nCode\nalt.Chart(movies_cleaned).mark_rect().encode(\n    alt.X('Worldwide_Gross',bin=alt.Bin(maxbins=100)),\n    alt.Y(\"Major_Genre\"),\n    alt.Color('count()'),\n    alt.Tooltip('count()')\n).properties(\n    title=\"Heatmap of Movie Counts by Gross and Genre\"\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis heatmap shows how frequently movies from each genre fall into different revenue ranges.\n\n\n2.2.4 Boxplot\nBoxplots are useful for comparing distributions across categories and identifying outliers. Boxplots summarize a distribution using five statistics:\n\nMedian (Q2)\nFirst Quartile (Q1)\nThird Quartile (Q3)\nLower Whisker (Q1 - 1.5 × IQR)\nUpper Whisker (Q3 + 1.5 × IQR)\n\n\n\nCode\nalt.Chart(movies_cleaned).mark_boxplot().encode(\n    alt.X('Worldwide_Gross'),\n    alt.Y(\"Major_Genre\")\n).properties(\n    title=\"Boxplot of Worldwide Gross by Genre\"\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.5 Side-by-side: Boxplot and Bar Chart\nTo contrast aggregated values (bar chart) with the full distribution (boxplot), we can display them together:\n\n\nCode\nbar = alt.Chart(movies_cleaned).mark_bar().encode(\n    alt.X('mean(Worldwide_Gross)'),\n    alt.Y(\"Major_Genre\")\n)\n\nbox = alt.Chart(movies_cleaned).mark_boxplot().encode(\n    alt.X('mean(Worldwide_Gross)'),\n    alt.Y(\"Major_Genre\")\n)\n\nbox | bar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis comparison reveals whether the mean is a good representative of the genre, or whether the data is skewed or contains outliers that affect the average",

    "text": "2.3 Bivariate Analysis: Quantitative vs Quantitative\nWhen analyzing two quantitative (numerical) variables simultaneously, we aim to discover possible relationships, trends, or correlations. This type of bivariate analysis can reveal whether increases in one variable are associated with increases or decreases in another (positive or negative correlation), or if there’s no relationship at all. The most common and intuitive visualization for this is the scatterplot.\n\n2.3.1 Scatterplots\nScatter plots are effective visualizations for exploring two-dimensional distributions, allowing us to identify patterns, trends, clusters, or outliers.\nLet’s start by visualizing how movies are rated across two popular online platforms:\n\nIMDb\n\nRotten Tomatoes\n\nAre movies rated similarly on different platforms?\n\n\nCode\nalt.Chart(movies_cleaned).mark_point().encode(\n    alt.X('IMDB_Rating'),\n    alt.Y('Rotten_Tomatoes_Rating')\n).properties(\n    title=\"IMDB vs Rotten Tomatoes Ratings\"\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3.2 Scatterplot Saturation\nScatterplots can become saturated when too many points overlap in a small area of the chart, making it difficult to distinguish dense regions from sparse ones. For example, when plotting financial variables like production budget versus worldwide gross:\n\n\nCode\nsaturated = alt.Chart(movies_cleaned).mark_point().encode(\n    alt.X('Production_Budget'),\n    alt.Y('Worldwide_Gross')\n).properties(\n    title=\"Saturated Scatterplot: Budget vs Gross\"\n)\nsaturated\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3.3 Using Binned Heatmap to Reduce Saturation\nTo address saturation, we can bin both variables and use a heatmap where the color intensity represents the number of movies that fall into each rectangular region of the grid. This makes dense areas more interpretable\n\n\nCode\nheatmap_scatter = alt.Chart(movies_cleaned).mark_rect().encode(\n    alt.X('Production_Budget', bin=alt.Bin(maxbins=60)),\n    alt.Y('Worldwide_Gross', bin=alt.Bin(maxbins=60)),\n    alt.Color('count()'),\n    alt.Tooltip('count()')\n).properties(\n    title=\"Binned Heatmap: Budget vs Gross\"\n)\nheatmap_scatter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3.4 Side-by-side Comparison\nCompare the raw scatterplot with the heatmap representation:\n\n\nCode\nsaturated | heatmap_scatter",

    "text": "2.4 Bivariate Analysis: Categorical vs Categorical\nWhen working with two categorical variables, bivariate analysis helps us understand how categories from one variable relate or are distributed across the other. For example, we might want to know how different movie genres are rated according to the MPAA rating system. Visualization techniques like grouped bar charts and faceted plots can reveal patterns, associations, or class imbalances.\n\n2.4.1 Basic Faceted Bar Chart\nWe begin by exploring how movies are rated (MPAA_Rating) across different genres (Major_Genre). A faceted bar chart allows us to visualize this relationship by plotting a bar chart per genre, helping to identify genre-specific rating distributions.\n\n\nCode\nalt.Chart(movies_cleaned).mark_bar().encode(\n    alt.X('count()'),\n    alt.Y('MPAA_Rating'),\n    alt.Color('MPAA_Rating')\n).facet(\n    'Major_Genre'\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.4.2 Vertical Faceting for Alignment\nFaceting horizontally can make comparisons across genres harder when the x-axis is misaligned. By specifying columns=1, we lay out the facets vertically, making it easier to compare counts across genres.\n\n\nCode\nalt.Chart(movies_cleaned).mark_bar().encode(\n    alt.X('count()'),\n    alt.Y('MPAA_Rating'),\n    alt.Color('MPAA_Rating')\n).facet(\n    'Major_Genre',\n    columns=1\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.4.3 Dependent vs Independent Axis Scaling\nBy default, facet plots share the same x-axis scale (dependent scale), which allows for easier comparison across panels. However, when the number of observations varies greatly between genres, this shared scale can compress some charts.\nWe can instead use independent x-axis scaling for each facet. This highlights the relative distribution within each genre.\n\n\nCode\nshared_scale = alt.Chart(movies_cleaned).mark_bar().encode(\n    alt.X('count()'),\n    alt.Y('MPAA_Rating'),\n    alt.Color('MPAA_Rating')\n).facet(\n    'Major_Genre',\n    columns=4\n)\n\nindependent_scale = alt.Chart(movies_cleaned).mark_bar().encode(\n    alt.X('count()'),\n    alt.Y('MPAA_Rating'),\n    alt.Color('MPAA_Rating')\n).facet(\n    'Major_Genre',\n    columns=4\n).resolve_scale(x='independent')\n\nshared_scale | independent_scale\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe left panel (shared scale) makes absolute comparisons between genres, while the right panel (independent scale) makes within-genre comparisons more readable.\n\n\n2.4.4 Heatmaps\nHeatmaps are effective for visualizing the relationship between two categorical variables when the goal is to display counts or frequency of occurrences. They map the number of observations to color, providing an intuitive view of which category pairs are most or least common.\nWe can enhance this basic representation by also using marker size, combining both color intensity and circle area to represent counts more effectively. This dual encoding can improve interpretation, especially when printed in grayscale or when there are subtle color differences.\n\n\nCode\nheatmap_color = alt.Chart(movies_cleaned).mark_rect().encode(\n    alt.X('MPAA_Rating'),\n    alt.Y('Major_Genre', sort='color'),\n    alt.Color('count()')\n).properties(\n    title=\"Heatmap with Color (Count of Movies)\"\n)\n\nheatmap_size = alt.Chart(movies_cleaned).mark_circle().encode(\n    alt.X('MPAA_Rating'),\n    alt.Y('Major_Genre', sort='color'),\n    alt.Color('count()'),\n    alt.Size('count()')\n).properties(\n    title=\"Heatmap with Color + Size (Count of Movies)\"\n)\n\nheatmap_color | heatmap_size",

In the context of numerical features, it is useful to explore pairwise distributions, correlations, and detect potential clusters or anomalies.\nWhen the number of variables is large, repeated charts such as histograms or scatter plot matrices help us summarize patterns efficiently and consistently across all numerical dimensions.\n\n2.5.1 Repeated Histograms for Numerical Columns\nWe first identify and isolate all numerical columns from the dataset. Then we repeat a histogram for each of these columns to understand the individual distributions. This overview is helpful to detect skewness, outliers, or binning decisions that affect how data is grouped visually.\n\n\nCode\n# Select only numerical columns\nnumerical_columns = movies_cleaned.select_dtypes('number').columns.tolist()\n\n\n\n\nCode\nalt.Chart(movies_cleaned).mark_bar().encode(\n    alt.X(alt.repeat(),type='quantitative',bin=alt.Bin(maxbins=30)),\n    alt.Y('count()')\n).properties(\n    width=150,\n    height=150\n).repeat(\n    numerical_columns,\n    columns=4\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.5.2 Scatter Plot Matrix (Pairplot)\nA scatter plot matrix shows the pairwise relationships between all numerical variables. This is a common exploratory tool to detect:\n\nCorrelations between variables\nOutliers or clusters\nRelationships useful for prediction models (e.g., to predict rating or budget)\n\nWe focus especially on the plots below the diagonal, as they are not duplicated.\n\n\nCode\nalt.Chart(movies_cleaned).mark_point().encode(\n    alt.X(alt.repeat('column'),type='quantitative'),\n    alt.Y(alt.repeat('row'),type='quantitative'),\n    alt.Tooltip('Title:N')\n).properties(\n    width=100,\n    height=100\n).repeat(\n    column=numerical_columns,\n    row=numerical_columns\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.5.3 Heatmap Matrix\nWhen scatter plots become too saturated (many overlapping points), heatmaps offer a better alternative by binning the numeric values and encoding the count in color intensity.\n\n\nCode\nalt.Chart(movies_cleaned).mark_rect().encode(\n    alt.X(alt.repeat('column'),type='quantitative',bin=alt.Bin(maxbins=30)),\n    alt.Y(alt.repeat('row'),type='quantitative',bin=alt.Bin(maxbins=30)),\n    alt.Color('count()'),\n    alt.Tooltip('count()')\n).properties(\n    width=100,\n    height=100\n).repeat(\n    column=numerical_columns,\n    row=numerical_columns\n).resolve_scale(\n    color='independent'\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo gain deeper insights into the dataset, it’s important to analyze how numerical variables behave across different categories.

This matrix layout gives a clear visual overview of how numerical values are distributed within each category.\n\n\nCode\nalt.Chart(movies_cleaned).mark_boxplot().encode(\n    alt.X(alt.repeat('column'),type='quantitative'),\n    alt.Y(alt.repeat('row'),type='nominal'),\n    alt.Size('count()')\n).properties(\n    width=200,\n    height=200\n).repeat(\n    column=numerical_columns,\n    row=categorical_filtered\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.5.6 Faceted Boxplots\nFor more focused analysis, we can facet the boxplots using a specific categorical variable like MPAA_Rating, and repeat the chart by different categorical rows. This lets us keep the numerical axis fixed while comparing how categories vary across different classes (e.g., movie ratings).\n\n\nCode\nalt.Chart(movies_cleaned).mark_boxplot().encode(\n    alt.X('Running_Time_min', type='quantitative'),\n    alt.Y(alt.repeat('row'),type='nominal'),\n    alt.Size('count()'),\n    alt.Tooltip('Title:N')\n).properties(\n    width=100,\n    height=100\n).facet(\n    column='MPAA_Rating'\n).repeat(\n    row=categorical_filtered\n)",

One day Trurl heard distant reports of two mighty constructor-benefactors, so wise and so accomplished that they had no equal; with this news he ran to Klapaucius, who explained to him that these were not mysterious rivals, but only themselves, for their fame had circumnavigated space. Fame, however, has this fault, that it says nothing of one\\'s failures, even when those very failures are the product of a great perfection. And he who would doubt this, let him recall the last of the seven sallies of Trurl, which was undertaken without Klapaucius, whom certain urgent duties kept at home at the time.\\n\\nIn those days Trurl was exceedingly vain, receiving all marks of veneration and honor paid to him as his due and a perfectly normal thing. He was heading north in his ship, as he was the least familiar with that region, and had flown through the void for quite some time, passing spheres full of the clamor of war as well as spheres that had finally obtained the perfect peace of desolation, when suddenly a little planet came into view, really more of a stray fragment of matter than a planet.\\n\\nOn the surface of this chunk of rock someone was running back and forth, jumping and waving his arms in the strangest way. Astonished by a scene of such total loneliness and concerned by those wild gestures of despair, and perhaps of anger as well, Trurl quickly landed.\\n\\nHe was approached by a personage of tremendous hauteur, iridium and vanadium all over and with a great deal of clanging and clanking, who introduced himself as Excelsius the Tartarian, ruler of Pancreon and Cyspenderora; the inhabitants of both these kingdoms had, in a fit of regicidal madness, driven His Highness from the throne and exiled him to this barren asteroid, eternally adrift among the dark swells and currents of gravitation.\\n\\nLearning in turn the identity of his visitor, the deposed monarch began to insist that Trurl - who after all was something of a professional when it came to good deeds - immediately restore him to his former position. The thought of such a turn of events brought the flame of vengeance to the monarch\\'s eyes, and his iron fingers clutched the air, as if already closing around the throats of his beloved subjects.\\n\\nNow Trurl had no intention of complying with this request of Excelsius, as doing so would bring about untold evil and suffering, yet at the same time he wished somehow to comfort and console the humiliated king. Thinking a moment or two, he came to the conclusion that, even in this case, not all was lost, for it would be possible to satisfy the king completely - without putting his former subjects in jeopardy. And so, rolling up his sleeves and summoning up all his mastery, Trurl built the king an entirely new kingdom. There were plenty of towns, rivers, mountains, forests, and brooks, a sky with clouds, armies full of derring-do, citadels, castles, and ladies\\' chambers; and there were marketplaces, gaudy and gleaming in the sun, days of back-breaking labor, nights full of dancing and song until dawn, and the gay clatter of swordplay. Trurl also carefully set into this kingdom a fabulous capital, all in marble and alabaster, and assembled a council of hoary sages, and winter palaces and summer villas, plots, conspirators, false witnesses, nurses, informers, teams of magnificent steeds, and plumes waving crimson in the wind; and then he crisscrossed that atmosphere with silver fanfares and twenty-one gun salutes, also threw in the necessary handful of traitors, another of heroes, added a pinch of prophets and seers, and one messiah and one great poet each, after which he bent over and set the works in motion, deftly making last-minute adjustments with his microscopic tools as it ran, and he gave the women of that kingdom beauty, the men - sullen silence and surliness when drunk, the officials - arrogance and servility, the astronomers - an enthusiasm for stars, and the children - a great capacity for noise. And all of this, connected, mounted and ground to precision, fit into a box, and not a very large box, but just the size that could be carried about with ease. This Trurl presented to Excelsius, to rule and have dominion over forever; but first he showed him where the input and output of his brand-new kingdom were, and how to program wars, quell rebellions, exact tribute, collect taxes, and also instructed him in the critical points and transition states of that microminiaturized society - in other words the maxima and minima of palace coups and revolutions -  and explained everything so well that the king, an old hand in the running of tyrannies, instantly grasped the directions and, without hesitation, while the constructor watched, issued a few trial proclamations, correctly manipulating the control knobs, which were carved with imperial eagles and regal lions. These proclamations declared a state of emergency, martial law, a curfew, and a special levy. After a year had passed in the kingdom, which amounted to hardly a minute for Trurl and the king, by an act of the greatest magnanimity - that is, by a flick of the finger at the controls - the king abolished one death penalty, lightened the levy, and deigned to annul the state of emergency, whereupon a tumultuous cry of gratitude, like the squeaking of tiny mice lifted by their tails, rose up from the box, and through its curved glass cover one could see, on the dusty highways and along the banks of lazy rivers that reflected the fluffy clouds, the people rejoicing and praising the great and unsurpassed benevolence of their sovereign lord.\\n\\nAnd so, though at first he had felt insulted by Trurl\\'s gift, in that the kingdom was too small and very like a child\\'s toy, the monarch saw that the thick glass lid made everything inside seem large; perhaps too he dully understood that size was not what mattered here, for government is not measured in meters and kilograms, and emotions are somehow the same, whether experienced by giants or dwarfs - and so he thanked the constructor, if somewhat stiffly. Who knows, he might even have liked to order him thrown in chains and tortured to death, just to be safe - that would have been a sure way of nipping in the bud any gossip about how some common vagabond tinkerer presented a mighty monarch with a kingdom. Excelsius was sensible enough, however, to see that this was out of the question, owing to a very fundamental disproportion, for fleas could sooner take their host into captivity than the king\\'s army seize Trurl. So with another cold nod, he stuck his orb and scepter under his arm, lifted the box kingdom with a grunt, and took it to his humble hut of exile. And as blazing day alternated with murky night outside, according to the rhythm of the asteroid\\'s rotation, the king, who was acknowledged by his subjects as the greatest in the world, diligently reigned, bidding this, forbidding that, beheading, rewarding - in all these ways incessantly spurring his little ones on to perfect fealty and worship of the throne.\\n\\nAs for Trurl, he returned home and related to his friend Klapaucius, not without pride, how he had employed his constructor\\'s genius to indulge the autocratic aspirations of Excelsius and, at the same time, safeguard the democratic aspirations of his former subjects. But Klapaucius, surprisingly enough, had no words of praise for Trurl; in fact, there seemed to be rebuke in his expression.\\n\\n\"Have I understood you correctly?\" he said at last. \"You gave that brutal despot, that born slave master, that slavering sadist of a pain- monger, you gave him a whole civilization to rule and have dominion over forever? And you tell me, moreover, of the cries of joy brought on by the repeal of a fraction of his cruel decrees! Trurl, how could you have done such a thing?\"\\n\\n\"You must be joking!\" Trurl exclaimed. \"Really, the whole kingdom fits into a box three feet by two by two and a half ... it\\'s only a model....\"\\n\\n\"A model of what?\"\\n\\n\"What do you mean, of what? Of a civilization, obviously, except that it\\'s a hundred million times smaller.â€\\x9d\\n\\n\"And how do you know there aren\\'t civilizations a hundred million times larger than our own? And if there were, would ours then be a model? And what importance do dimensions have anyway? In that box kingdom, doesn\\'t a journey from the capital to one of the corners take months - for those inhabitants? And don\\'t they suffer, don\\'t they know the burden of labor, don\\'t they die?\"\\n\\n\"Now just a minute, you know yourself that all these processes take place only because I programmed them, and so they aren\\'t genuine....\"\\n\\n\"Aren\\'t genuine? You mean to say the box is empty, and the parades, tortures, and beheadings are merely an illusion?\"\\n\\n\"Not an illusion, no, since they have reality, though purely as certain microscopic phenomena, which I produced by manipulating atoms,\" said Trurl. \"The point is, these births, loves, acts of heroism, and denunciations are nothing but the minuscule capering of electrons in space, precisely arranged by the skill of my nonlinear craft, which - \"\\n\\n\"Enough of your boasting, not another word!\" Klapaucius snapped. \"Are these processes self-organizing or not?\"\\n\\n\"Of course they are!\"\\n\\n\"And they occur among infinitesimal clouds of electrical charge?\"\\n\\n\"You know they do.\"\"And the phenomenological events of dawns, sunsets, and bloody battles are generated by the concatenation of real variables?\"\\n\\n\"Certainly.\"\\n\\n\"And are not we as well, if you examine us physically, mechanistically, statistically, and meticulously, nothing but the miniscule capering of electron clouds? Positive and negative charges arranged in space? And is our existence not the result of subatomic collisions and the interplay of particles, though we ourselves perceive those molecular cartwheels as fear, longing, or meditation? And when you daydream, what transpires within your brain but the binary algebra of connecting and disconnecting circuits, the continual meandering of electrons?\"\\n\\n\"What, Klapaucius, would you equate our existence with that of an imitation kingdom locked up in some glass box?!\" cried Trurl. \"No, really, that\\'s going too far! My purpose was simply to fashion a simulator of statehood, a model cybernetically perfect, nothing more!\"\\n\\n\"Trurl! Our perfection is our curse, for it draws down upon our every endeavor no end of unforeseeable consequences!\" Klapaucius said in a stentorian voice. \"If an imperfect imitator, wishing to inflict pain, were to build himself a crude idol of wood or wax, and further give it some makeshift semblance of a sentient being, his torture of the thing would be a paltry mockery indeed! But consider a succession of improvements on this practice! Consider the next sculptor, who builds a doll with a recording in its belly, that it may groan beneath his blows; consider a doll which, when beaten, begs for mercy, no longer a crude idol, but a homeostat; consider a doll that sheds tears, a doll that bleeds, a doll that fears death, though it also longs for the peace that only death can bring! Don\\'t you see, when the imitator is perfect, so must be the imitation, and the semblance becomes the truth, the pretense a reality! Trurl, you took an untold number of creatures capable of suffering and abandoned them forever to the rule of a wicked tyrant.... Trurl, you have committed a terrible crime!\"\\n\\n\"Sheer sophistry!\" shouted Trurl, all the louder because he felt the force of his friend\\'s argument. \"Electrons meander not only in our brains, but in phonograph records as well, which proves nothing, and certainly gives no grounds for such hypostatical analogies! The subjects of that monster Excelsius do in fact die when decapitated, sob, fight, and fall in love, since that is how I set up the parameters, but it\\'s impossible to say, Klapaucius, that they feel anything in the process - the electrons jumping around in their heads will tell you nothing of that!\"\\n\\n\"And if I were to look inside your head, I would also see nothing but electrons,\" replied Klapaucius. \"Come now, don\\'t pretend not to understand what I\\'m saying, I know you\\'re not that stupid! A phonograph record won\\'t run errands for you, won\\'t beg for mercy or fall on its knees! You say there\\'s no way of knowing whether Excelsius\\'s subjects groan, when beaten, purely because of the electrons hopping about inside - like wheels grinding out the mimicry of a voice - or whether they really groan, that is, because they honestly experience the pain? A pretty distinction, this! No, Trurl, a sufferer is not one who hands you his suffering, that you may touch it, weigh it, bite it like a coin; a sufferer is one who behaves like a sufferer! Prove to me here and now, once and for all, that they do not feel, that they do not think, that they do not in any way exist as being conscious of their enclosure between the two abysses of oblivion - the abyss before birth and the abyss that follows death - prove this to me, Trurl, and I\\'ll leave you be! Prove that you only imitated suffering, and did not create it!\\n\\n\"You know perfectly well that\\'s impossible,\" answered Trurl quietly. \"Even before I took my instruments in hand, when the box was still empty, I had to anticipate the possibility of precisely such a proof - in order to rule it out. For otherwise the monarch of that kingdom sooner or later would have gotten the impression that his subjects were not real subjects at all, but puppets, marionettes. Try to understand, there was no other way to do it! Anything that would have destroyed in the littlest way the illusion of complete reality would have also destroyed the importance, the dignity of governing, and turned it into nothing but a mechanical game....\"\\n\\n\"I understand, I understand all too well!\" cried Klapaucius. \"Your intentions were the noblest - you only sought to construct a kingdom as lifelike as possible, so similar to a real kingdom, that no one, absolutely no one, could ever tell the difference, and in this, I am afraid, you were successful! Only hours have passed since your return, but for them, the ones imprisoned in that box, whole centuries have gone by - how many beings, how many lives wasted, and all to gratify and feed the vanity of King Excelsius!\"\\n\\nWithout another word Trurl rushed back to his ship, but saw that his friend was coming with him. When he had blasted off into space, pointed the bow between two great clusters of eternal flame and opened the throttle all the way, Klapaucius said:\\n\\n\"Trurl, you\\'re hopeless. You always act first, think later. And now what do you intend to do when we get there?\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll take the kingdom away from him!\"\\n\\n\"And what will you do with it?\"\\n\\n\"Destroy it!\" Trurl was about to shout, but choked on the first syllable when he realized what he was saying. Finally he mumbled:\\n\\n\"I\\'ll hold an election. Let them choose just rulers from among themselves.\"\\n\\n\"You programmed them all to be feudal lords or shiftless vassals. What good would an election do? First you\\'d have to undo the entire structure of the kingdom, then assemble from scratch ...\"\"And where,\" exclaimed Trurl, \"does the changing of structures end and the tampering with minds begin?!\" Klapaucius had no answer for this, and they flew on in gloomy silence, till the planet of Excelsius came into view. As they circled it, preparing to land, they beheld a most amazing sight.\\n\\nThe entire planet was covered with countless signs of intelligent life. Microscopic bridges, like tiny lines, spanned every rill and rivulet, while the puddles, reflecting the stars, were full of microscopic boats like floating chips.... The night side of the sphere was dotted with glimmering cities, and on the day side one could make out flourishing metropolises, though the inhabitants themselves were much too little to observe, even through the strongest lens. Of the king there was not a trace, as if the earth had swallowed him up.\\n\\n\"He isn\\'t here,\" said Trurl in an awed whisper. \"What have they done with him? Somehow they managed to break through the walls of their box and occupy the asteroid....\"\\n\\n\"Look!\" said Klapaucius, pointing to a little cloud no larger than a thimble and shaped like a mushroom; it slowly rose into the atmosphere. \"They\\'ve discovered atomic energy.... And over there - you see that bit of glass? It\\'s the remains of the box, they\\'ve made it into some sort of temple....\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t understand. It was only a model, after all. A process with a large number of parameters, a simulation, a mock-up for a monarch to practice on, with the necessary feedback, variables, multistats ...\" muttered Trurl, dumbfounded.\\n\\n\"Yes. But you made the unforgivable mistake of overperfecting your replica. Not wanting to build a mere clocklike mechanism, you inadvertently - in your punctilious way - created that which was possible, logical, and inevitable, that which became the very antithesis of a mechanism....\"\\n\\n\"Please, no more!\" cried Trurl. And they looked out upon the asteroid in silence, when suddenly something bumped their ship, or rather grazed it slightly. They saw this object, for it was illuminated by the thin ribbon of flame that issued from its tail. A ship, probably, or perhaps an artificial satellite, though remarkably similar to one of those steel boots the tyrant Excelsius used to wear. And when the constructors raised their eyes, they beheld a heavenly body shining high above the tiny planet -  it hadn\\'t been there previously - and they recognized, in that cold, pale orb, the stern features of Excelsius himself, who had in this way become the Moon of the Microminians.'",

    "text": "Code\nurl = \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erickedu85/dataset/master/story.txt\"\n\nr = requests.get(url)\nr.encoding = \"utf-8\"\n\nstory = r.text\nstory\n\n\n'The seventh Sally or how Trurl\\'s own perfection led to no good\\nBy StanisÅ‚aw Lem, 1965.\\nTranslated by Michael Kandel, 1974.\\n\\nThe Universe is infinite but bounded, and therefore a beam of light, in whatever direction it may travel, will after billions of centuries return -  if powerful enough - to the point of its departure; and it is no different with rumor, that flies about from star to star and makes the rounds of every planet. One day Trurl heard distant reports of two mighty constructor-benefactors, so wise and so accomplished that they had no equal; with this news he ran to Klapaucius, who explained to him that these were not mysterious rivals, but only themselves, for their fame had circumnavigated space. Fame, however, has this fault, that it says nothing of one\\'s failures, even when those very failures are the product of a great perfection. And he who would doubt this, let him recall the last of the seven sallies of Trurl, which was undertaken without Klapaucius, whom certain urgent duties kept at home at the time.\\n\\nIn those days Trurl was exceedingly vain, receiving all marks of veneration and honor paid to him as his due and a perfectly normal thing. He was heading north in his ship, as he was the least familiar with that region, and had flown through the void for quite some time, passing spheres full of the clamor of war as well as spheres that had finally obtained the perfect peace of desolation, when suddenly a little planet came into view, really more of a stray fragment of matter than a planet.\\n\\nOn the surface of this chunk of rock someone was running back and forth, jumping and waving his arms in the strangest way. Astonished by a scene of such total loneliness and concerned by those wild gestures of despair, and perhaps of anger as well, Trurl quickly landed.\\n\\nHe was approached by a personage of tremendous hauteur, iridium and vanadium all over and with a great deal of clanging and clanking, who introduced himself as Excelsius the Tartarian, ruler of Pancreon and Cyspenderora; the inhabitants of both these kingdoms had, in a fit of regicidal madness, driven His Highness from the throne and exiled him to this barren asteroid, eternally adrift among the dark swells and currents of gravitation.\\n\\nLearning in turn the identity of his visitor, the deposed monarch began to insist that Trurl - who after all was something of a professional when it came to good deeds - immediately restore him to his former position. The thought of such a turn of events brought the flame of vengeance to the monarch\\'s eyes, and his iron fingers clutched the air, as if already closing around the throats of his beloved subjects.\\n\\nNow Trurl had no intention of complying with this request of Excelsius, as doing so would bring about untold evil and suffering, yet at the same time he wished somehow to comfort and console the humiliated king. Thinking a moment or two, he came to the conclusion that, even in this case, not all was lost, for it would be possible to satisfy the king completely - without putting his former subjects in jeopardy. And so, rolling up his sleeves and summoning up all his mastery, Trurl built the king an entirely new kingdom. There were plenty of towns, rivers, mountains, forests, and brooks, a sky with clouds, armies full of derring-do, citadels, castles, and ladies\\' chambers; and there were marketplaces, gaudy and gleaming in the sun, days of back-breaking labor, nights full of dancing and song until dawn, and the gay clatter of swordplay. Trurl also carefully set into this kingdom a fabulous capital, all in marble and alabaster, and assembled a council of hoary sages, and winter palaces and summer villas, plots, conspirators, false witnesses, nurses, informers, teams of magnificent steeds, and plumes waving crimson in the wind; and then he crisscrossed that atmosphere with silver fanfares and twenty-one gun salutes, also threw in the necessary handful of traitors, another of heroes, added a pinch of prophets and seers, and one messiah and one great poet each, after which he bent over and set the works in motion, deftly making last-minute adjustments with his microscopic tools as it ran, and he gave the women of that kingdom beauty, the men - sullen silence and surliness when drunk, the officials - arrogance and servility, the astronomers - an enthusiasm for stars, and the children - a great capacity for noise. And all of this, connected, mounted and ground to precision, fit into a box, and not a very large box, but just the size that could be carried about with ease. This Trurl presented to Excelsius, to rule and have dominion over forever; but first he showed him where the input and output of his brand-new kingdom were, and how to program wars, quell rebellions, exact tribute, collect taxes, and also instructed him in the critical points and transition states of that microminiaturized society - in other words the maxima and minima of palace coups and revolutions -  and explained everything so well that the king, an old hand in the running of tyrannies, instantly grasped the directions and, without hesitation, while the constructor watched, issued a few trial proclamations, correctly manipulating the control knobs, which were carved with imperial eagles and regal lions. These proclamations declared a state of emergency, martial law, a curfew, and a special levy. After a year had passed in the kingdom, which amounted to hardly a minute for Trurl and the king, by an act of the greatest magnanimity - that is, by a flick of the finger at the controls - the king abolished one death penalty, lightened the levy, and deigned to annul the state of emergency, whereupon a tumultuous cry of gratitude, like the squeaking of tiny mice lifted by their tails, rose up from the box, and through its curved glass cover one could see, on the dusty highways and along the banks of lazy rivers that reflected the fluffy clouds, the people rejoicing and praising the great and unsurpassed benevolence of their sovereign lord.\\n\\nAnd so, though at first he had felt insulted by Trurl\\'s gift, in that the kingdom was too small and very like a child\\'s toy, the monarch saw that the thick glass lid made everything inside seem large; perhaps too he dully understood that size was not what mattered here, for government is not measured in meters and kilograms, and emotions are somehow the same, whether experienced by giants or dwarfs - and so he thanked the constructor, if somewhat stiffly. Who knows, he might even have liked to order him thrown in chains and tortured to death, just to be safe - that would have been a sure way of nipping in the bud any gossip about how some common vagabond tinkerer presented a mighty monarch with a kingdom. Excelsius was sensible enough, however, to see that this was out of the question, owing to a very fundamental disproportion, for fleas could sooner take their host into captivity than the king\\'s army seize Trurl. So with another cold nod, he stuck his orb and scepter under his arm, lifted the box kingdom with a grunt, and took it to his humble hut of exile. And as blazing day alternated with murky night outside, according to the rhythm of the asteroid\\'s rotation, the king, who was acknowledged by his subjects as the greatest in the world, diligently reigned, bidding this, forbidding that, beheading, rewarding - in all these ways incessantly spurring his little ones on to perfect fealty and worship of the throne.\\n\\nAs for Trurl, he returned home and related to his friend Klapaucius, not without pride, how he had employed his constructor\\'s genius to indulge the autocratic aspirations of Excelsius and, at the same time, safeguard the democratic aspirations of his former subjects. But Klapaucius, surprisingly enough, had no words of praise for Trurl; in fact, there seemed to be rebuke in his expression.\\n\\n\"Have I understood you correctly?\" he said at last. \"You gave that brutal despot, that born slave master, that slavering sadist of a pain- monger, you gave him a whole civilization to rule and have dominion over forever? And you tell me, moreover, of the cries of joy brought on by the repeal of a fraction of his cruel decrees! Trurl, how could you have done such a thing?\"\\n\\n\"You must be joking!\" Trurl exclaimed. \"Really, the whole kingdom fits into a box three feet by two by two and a half ... it\\'s only a model....\"\\n\\n\"A model of what?\"\\n\\n\"What do you mean, of what? Of a civilization, obviously, except that it\\'s a hundred million times smaller.â€\\x9d\\n\\n\"And how do you know there aren\\'t civilizations a hundred million times larger than our own? And if there were, would ours then be a model? And what importance do dimensions have anyway? In that box kingdom, doesn\\'t a journey from the capital to one of the corners take months - for those inhabitants? And don\\'t they suffer, don\\'t they know the burden of labor, don\\'t they die?\"\\n\\n\"Now just a minute, you know yourself that all these processes take place only because I programmed them, and so they aren\\'t genuine....\"\\n\\n\"Aren\\'t genuine? You mean to say the box is empty, and the parades, tortures, and beheadings are merely an illusion?\"\\n\\n\"Not an illusion, no, since they have reality, though purely as certain microscopic phenomena, which I produced by manipulating atoms,\" said Trurl. \"The point is, these births, loves, acts of heroism, and denunciations are nothing but the minuscule capering of electrons in space, precisely arranged by the skill of my nonlinear craft, which - \"\\n\\n\"Enough of your boasting, not another word!\" Klapaucius snapped. \"Are these processes self-organizing or not?\"\\n\\n\"Of course they are!\"\\n\\n\"And they occur among infinitesimal clouds of electrical charge?\"\\n\\n\"You know they do.\"\"And the phenomenological events of dawns, sunsets, and bloody battles are generated by the concatenation of real variables?\"\\n\\n\"Certainly.\"\\n\\n\"And are not we as well, if you examine us physically, mechanistically, statistically, and meticulously, nothing but the miniscule capering of electron clouds? Positive and negative charges arranged in space? And is our existence not the result of subatomic collisions and the interplay of particles, though we ourselves perceive those molecular cartwheels as fear, longing, or meditation? And when you daydream, what transpires within your brain but the binary algebra of connecting and disconnecting circuits, the continual meandering of electrons?\"\\n\\n\"What, Klapaucius, would you equate our existence with that of an imitation kingdom locked up in some glass box?!\" cried Trurl. \"No, really, that\\'s going too far! My purpose was simply to fashion a simulator of statehood, a model cybernetically perfect, nothing more!\"\\n\\n\"Trurl! Our perfection is our curse, for it draws down upon our every endeavor no end of unforeseeable consequences!\" Klapaucius said in a stentorian voice. \"If an imperfect imitator, wishing to inflict pain, were to build himself a crude idol of wood or wax, and further give it some makeshift semblance of a sentient being, his torture of the thing would be a paltry mockery indeed! But consider a succession of improvements on this practice! Consider the next sculptor, who builds a doll with a recording in its belly, that it may groan beneath his blows; consider a doll which, when beaten, begs for mercy, no longer a crude idol, but a homeostat; consider a doll that sheds tears, a doll that bleeds, a doll that fears death, though it also longs for the peace that only death can bring! Don\\'t you see, when the imitator is perfect, so must be the imitation, and the semblance becomes the truth, the pretense a reality! Trurl, you took an untold number of creatures capable of suffering and abandoned them forever to the rule of a wicked tyrant.... Trurl, you have committed a terrible crime!\"\\n\\n\"Sheer sophistry!\" shouted Trurl, all the louder because he felt the force of his friend\\'s argument. \"Electrons meander not only in our brains, but in phonograph records as well, which proves nothing, and certainly gives no grounds for such hypostatical analogies! The subjects of that monster Excelsius do in fact die when decapitated, sob, fight, and fall in love, since that is how I set up the parameters, but it\\'s impossible to say, Klapaucius, that they feel anything in the process - the electrons jumping around in their heads will tell you nothing of that!\"\\n\\n\"And if I were to look inside your head, I would also see nothing but electrons,\" replied Klapaucius. \"Come now, don\\'t pretend not to understand what I\\'m saying, I know you\\'re not that stupid! A phonograph record won\\'t run errands for you, won\\'t beg for mercy or fall on its knees! You say there\\'s no way of knowing whether Excelsius\\'s subjects groan, when beaten, purely because of the electrons hopping about inside - like wheels grinding out the mimicry of a voice - or whether they really groan, that is, because they honestly experience the pain? A pretty distinction, this! No, Trurl, a sufferer is not one who hands you his suffering, that you may touch it, weigh it, bite it like a coin; a sufferer is one who behaves like a sufferer! Prove to me here and now, once and for all, that they do not feel, that they do not think, that they do not in any way exist as being conscious of their enclosure between the two abysses of oblivion - the abyss before birth and the abyss that follows death - prove this to me, Trurl, and I\\'ll leave you be! Prove that you only imitated suffering, and did not create it!\\n\\n\"You know perfectly well that\\'s impossible,\" answered Trurl quietly. \"Even before I took my instruments in hand, when the box was still empty, I had to anticipate the possibility of precisely such a proof - in order to rule it out. For otherwise the monarch of that kingdom sooner or later would have gotten the impression that his subjects were not real subjects at all, but puppets, marionettes. Try to understand, there was no other way to do it! Anything that would have destroyed in the littlest way the illusion of complete reality would have also destroyed the importance, the dignity of governing, and turned it into nothing but a mechanical game....\"\\n\\n\"I understand, I understand all too well!\" cried Klapaucius. \"Your intentions were the noblest - you only sought to construct a kingdom as lifelike as possible, so similar to a real kingdom, that no one, absolutely no one, could ever tell the difference, and in this, I am afraid, you were successful! Only hours have passed since your return, but for them, the ones imprisoned in that box, whole centuries have gone by - how many beings, how many lives wasted, and all to gratify and feed the vanity of King Excelsius!\"\\n\\nWithout another word Trurl rushed back to his ship, but saw that his friend was coming with him. When he had blasted off into space, pointed the bow between two great clusters of eternal flame and opened the throttle all the way, Klapaucius said:\\n\\n\"Trurl, you\\'re hopeless. You always act first, think later. And now what do you intend to do when we get there?\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll take the kingdom away from him!\"\\n\\n\"And what will you do with it?\"\\n\\n\"Destroy it!\" Trurl was about to shout, but choked on the first syllable when he realized what he was saying. Finally he mumbled:\\n\\n\"I\\'ll hold an election. Let them choose just rulers from among themselves.\"\\n\\n\"You programmed them all to be feudal lords or shiftless vassals. What good would an election do? First you\\'d have to undo the entire structure of the kingdom, then assemble from scratch ...\"\"And where,\" exclaimed Trurl, \"does the changing of structures end and the tampering with minds begin?!\" Klapaucius had no answer for this, and they flew on in gloomy silence, till the planet of Excelsius came into view. As they circled it, preparing to land, they beheld a most amazing sight.\\n\\nThe entire planet was covered with countless signs of intelligent life. Microscopic bridges, like tiny lines, spanned every rill and rivulet, while the puddles, reflecting the stars, were full of microscopic boats like floating chips.... The night side of the sphere was dotted with glimmering cities, and on the day side one could make out flourishing metropolises, though the inhabitants themselves were much too little to observe, even through the strongest lens. Of the king there was not a trace, as if the earth had swallowed him up.\\n\\n\"He isn\\'t here,\" said Trurl in an awed whisper. \"What have they done with him? Somehow they managed to break through the walls of their box and occupy the asteroid....\"\\n\\n\"Look!\" said Klapaucius, pointing to a little cloud no larger than a thimble and shaped like a mushroom; it slowly rose into the atmosphere. \"They\\'ve discovered atomic energy.... And over there - you see that bit of glass? It\\'s the remains of the box, they\\'ve made it into some sort of temple....\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t understand. It was only a model, after all. A process with a large number of parameters, a simulation, a mock-up for a monarch to practice on, with the necessary feedback, variables, multistats ...\" muttered Trurl, dumbfounded.\\n\\n\"Yes. But you made the unforgivable mistake of overperfecting your replica. Not wanting to build a mere clocklike mechanism, you inadvertently - in your punctilious way - created that which was possible, logical, and inevitable, that which became the very antithesis of a mechanism....\"\\n\\n\"Please, no more!\" cried Trurl. And they looked out upon the asteroid in silence, when suddenly something bumped their ship, or rather grazed it slightly. They saw this object, for it was illuminated by the thin ribbon of flame that issued from its tail. A ship, probably, or perhaps an artificial satellite, though remarkably similar to one of those steel boots the tyrant Excelsius used to wear. And when the constructors raised their eyes, they beheld a heavenly body shining high above the tiny planet -  it hadn\\'t been there previously - and they recognized, in that cold, pale orb, the stern features of Excelsius himself, who had in this way become the Moon of the Microminians.'",

EDT\\n\\t     \\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I guess I\\'m just prepared to take \\nquestions today.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, Bob Dole says that the Clinton \\nadministration\\'s policy on Bosnia is a failure and that he wants the \\nUnited States to take the lead in lifting the arms embargo so that \\nthe Bosnian Muslims can defend themselves.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As you know, President Clinton has \\nsaid that that suggestion is under active consideration.  Obviously, \\nthis is a tragic situation in Bosnia.  And if the Bosnian Serbs don\\'t \\ncome to the negotiating table in a constructive way, we\\'ll look \\nseriously at pressing for lifting the arms embargo.  In the meantime, \\nwe\\'re going to continue to press for a tough sanctions resolution in \\nthe U.N.  We\\'re going to continue to work on the Serbs to come to the \\nnegotiating table.  But the prospect of an arms embargo is something \\nthe President certainly will consider if the Serbs don\\'t come to the \\ntable.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  How much longer are you going to give them to come \\nto the table, George?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We\\'re working on that right now.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  It\\'s been a long time.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  On February 19th, the President mentioned the value \\nadded tax in Ohio.  And when he was asked about it later by \\nreporters, he said -- quote -- \"That is a radical change in the tax \\nsystem of the United States.  It\\'s something I think we may have to \\nlook at in the years ahead.\"  Questioned again about it later he \\nsays, \"It is not something that is now under consideration.  If we \\nstart considering it, I\\'ll tell you.\"  It wasn\\'t a trial balloon or \\nanything, he said.  I was just discussing the tax response to a \\nquestion.  Donna Shalala, quoted in USA Today this morning -- quote -\\n- \"Certainly we\\'re looking at a VAT.\"  What\\'s gone on?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  The same with Alice Rivlin this morning.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The health care task force is \\nreviewing a number of options.  They haven\\'t made any decisions yet.  \\nAnd as I have said from this podium time and time again, we\\'re not \\ngoing to comment on decisions that haven\\'t been made.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  But you have also said from this podium time and \\ntime again --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Wait a minute.  Whoa, Nelly.  Whoa.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     that that was not under consideration.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Yes.  Clinton says, \"It is not something that is \\nnow under consideration.\"  Is that no longer true?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I believe the working group, as Ms. \\nShalala says, has looked at this prospect, but no decisions have been \\nmade of any kind.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Well, I know.  But he said he\\'d tell us about it if \\nit was ever under consideration.  I take it that now he is and he \\ndidn\\'t tell us about it or --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Did he say if it was under \\nconsideration or if it was something to be proposed?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  \"If we start considering I\\'ll tell you.\"\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  If it\\'s something to be proposed?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  \"If we start considering it, I\\'ll tell you.\"  \\nThat\\'s a direct quote.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The task force has looked at a \\nnumber of different options.  They have not made any decisions yet.  \\nThe President has not made any decisions yet.  This is -- one of the \\nproposals under consideration by the task force was to go out and \\ncast as wide a net as possible for different ideas on how to reform \\nthe health care system.  They have cast a very wide net.  They have \\nlooked at hundreds of different proposals -- probably thousands of \\ndifferent proposals.  But the President has not made any decisions.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Well, is the President aware of their consideration \\nof this option?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t know if he\\'s been briefed \\non any preliminary conclusions or anything like that from the task \\nforce on this specific proposal of any kind.  I don\\'t know that \\nthat\\'s gotten to his level.  He started yesterday to go through with \\nthe task force a very wide range of decisions and I don\\'t believe \\nthat that\\'s been presented to him, no.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Well, he\\'s not relying on the USA Today to tell him \\nwhat his task force is considering in the way of taxes.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, he\\'s going through it in a very \\ndeliberate fashion.  There are a number of decisions that have to be \\nmade.  I don\\'t know that this proposal has reached that decision-\\nmaking point.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  If this is still under consideration, that\\'s a \\nchange, at least from what we\\'ve been told by Dee Dee, I think about \\nthree weeks ago or so.  She said, that is not an option, talking \\nabout the -- had a big argument with somebody over this, so I \\nremember it specifically -- and said it not once, but twice.  Is that \\nnot the case?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I don\\'t know if this has \\nbeen presented to the President as something that is being looked at \\nat some level in the task force.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  It was ruled it out, though.  I mean, unlike other \\noptions that you\\'ve kept in the mix, this one specifically was ruled \\nout.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, this is something that is \\nbeing looked at, but no decision has been made of any kind.  I mean, \\nit doesn\\'t -- it\\'s not necessarily material until you get to the \\ndecision-making phase.  The working groups are looking at hundreds of \\ndifferent options.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  If it was ruled out before and it\\'s not ruled out \\nnow, then something has changed, George.  Yes, no?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  When a guy says in February --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the working groups are \\nlooking at the widest possible range of options.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  So something\\'s changed.  They weren\\'t looking at it \\nbefore; they\\'re looking at it now.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I don\\'t know if the working \\ngroups have gotten to that point yet.  They are casting a very wide \\nnet.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  How was it possible that you and Dee Dee were able \\nto sell -- definitively rule it out as an option previously and now \\nare saying that, in fact, it is being considered?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, the working groups are \\nlooking at a wide range of options.  They have not --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Do you deny that you and Dee Dee ruled it -- flatly \\nruled it out on several occasions in the past month?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t deny that -- I mean, those \\nare the President\\'s words.  Those are very clear.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Subsequent to the President\\'s words, do you deny \\nthat within the last month you and Dee Dee have both publicly ruled \\nit out?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t know about the timing.  I \\nthink what we did was refer back to the President\\'s words and say \\nthey stand.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  So don\\'t they stand any longer?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  March 25th, Clinton said for the next four to five \\nyears it was ruled out.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, those words -- the President \\ndid say that in February.  The working groups are on a separate \\ntrack, and as I said, I don\\'t believe --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Separate from the President?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t believe this has been \\npresented to the President.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Are they considering something that the President \\n--\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Has ruled out?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     has ruled out?  I mean, will the President \\nconsider a VAT tax?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, the working groups have not \\npresented this to the President.  They have looked at a wide range of \\noptions.  I suppose that if an argument is made, he will clearly \\nlisten to it.  That does not mean he has decided to do it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Can we put this another way?  In his answer in \\nOhio, he looked at the VAT in terms of restructuring the whole tax \\nsystem.  Under those -- that was the circumstance that he said it \\nmight be considered at some future point.  Is that no longer the \\ncase, or is that the only way that he can see a VAT emerging?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I guess I\\'m not sure exactly what \\nyou\\'re asking.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  He talked about the VAT in the context of a \\nrestructured tax system, not as a specific way to finance health \\ncare, for example.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Or anything else.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Or anything else.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  It was always in the context of substituting for \\nother taxes at a time of a dramatic overhaul of the whole tax system.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Right.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Has that change, too?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is that still his view?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I haven\\'t spoken about those \\nspecific comments.  I think -- I can just go back to it -- are the \\nworking groups -- have they examined the possibility of a VAT?  Yes, \\nthey have.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Certainly we\\'re looking at a VAT, she said.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They have examined the possibility \\nof a VAT.  Has it been presented to the President?  Has he made a \\ndecision?  No, he has not.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What kind of a deal do you have when you\\'ve got the \\nPresident\\'s appointed task force, obviously not oblivious to his \\nruling something out except in the context of some huge down the line \\nreform, goes ahead on its own and considers a tax which he has \\nspecifically ruled out in any context other than much later, and then \\ngoes ahead and announces that that\\'s what they\\'re looking at?  Is the \\nPresident concerned about that sort of thing?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that the President\\'s \\nconcern is to make sure he gets the best health care proposal \\npossible.  He\\'s concerned with making sure that they have the most \\nthorough process for examining all the possible alternatives, all the \\ndifferent alternatives.  If a decision is made to go forward with \\nsomething like that it\\'s certainly something the President will \\nexplain and justify.  But no decision has been made along those \\nlines.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What does it mean exactly, though, when the \\nPresident rules something out?  Does it mean it can get back on the \\ntable later if a more persuasive argument is made?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That\\'s just -- that\\'s indisputably \\ntrue.  If you -- but, at the same time, he has not ruled it in.  He \\nhas not made a proposal.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What makes him open to it now when he wasn\\'t open \\nto it before?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He\\'s certainly willing to listen to \\nthe argument.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Was he willing to listen to the argument for a \\nshort-term tax this year, and he wasn\\'t willing to listen to it in \\nChilicothe?  He\\'s now open to it --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The context of his comments was \\nthat it was not something -- he wanted to be clear that this is not \\nsomething he was proposing, not something he was floating.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Not something he was considering.  Those are his \\nwords -- \"It\\'s not something that\\'s now under consideration.  If we \\nstart considering it, I\\'ll tell you.\"  You\\'re now acknowledging, are \\nyou not, that it is under consideration and --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I\\'m acknowledging that the task \\nforce has studied this proposal.  I am also stating that the \\nPresident has not made a decision on it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  But the door is open for the President to \\nreconsider including this as part of --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Obviously, the working groups are \\nlooking at it.  Again, but the President has not made a decision.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Do you know if they will make a presentation on \\nbehalf of the VAT to him?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t know that.  I assume that \\nif -- I don\\'t know what stage they are it in proposing.  I don\\'t know \\nthat they\\'re going to make the conclusion that this is something they \\nshould present to him.  I know this is something the working groups \\nare looking at.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Do you understand, George, that none of us are \\nasking these questions in context of a decision that the President \\nhas made, only about what the President is considering?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I understand that, and I am \\nacknowledging that the working groups have examined the issue of a \\nVAT.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  And the President will consider it?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I assume that he will consider the \\nargument if it is presented to him.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Does that mean the President -- that working groups \\nthink that when the President says no, he means maybe?  (Laughter.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that means that the working \\ngroups are trying to do the most thorough job possible.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, can I ask you another question about \\nBosnia?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Sure.  (Laughter.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  No, he wants us to stay on this.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Let\\'s do gays in the military.  (Laughter.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  No, he got out of that swamp.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  I think we\\'ve gotten the bottom line on that VAT.  \\nReggie Bartholomew, your Special Ambassador in Belgrade, today said \\nthat if the Serbs do not accept the agreement that has been worked \\nout -- quote -- \"We will do our part to pursue the lifting of the \\narms embargo together with our allies.\"  That seems to go a bit \\nfurther than what you\\'ve just said --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Sounds almost exactly what I just \\nsaid.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Well, do you accept -- in other words, you accept \\nwhat Reggie --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the President has said that \\nthis is something that\\'s under consideration.  It is something he \\nwill consider if the current actions don\\'t bring the Serbs to the \\ntable.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Isn\\'t there some kind of timetable here?  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes, there is a timetable.  There\\'s \\ngoing to be a vote on the U.N. resolution in about 10 days.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  That\\'s on sanctions, that\\'s on tightening the \\nsanctions.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That\\'s right, that\\'s sanctions.  \\nAnd we believe that that will ratchet up the pressure, and we hope \\nthat that will bring the Serbs to the table.  As you know, Mr. \\nBartholomew also met with Mr. Churkin of Russia, and they are also \\nworking on ways to bring the Serbs to the table.  We will continue to \\npressure them in many different ways and this is one possible option \\nas well.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  The question is whether there\\'s a timetable for \\nconsideration or a vote on a decision on lifting the arms embargo, \\nnot the sanctions.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The next vote in the U.N. is on \\nsanctions.  As far as I know, there are no votes scheduled on lifting \\nthe arms embargo.  But it is something that we have discussed both \\ninternally and with our allies.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Why did Reggie Bartholomew tell the Serbs that the \\nU.S. would do that?  What was the point of his telling them that?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, clearly, I mean, this is \\nsomething that\\'s under consideration, and this is something that we \\ntake quite seriously if they do not come to the table.  They should \\nknow the consequences of failing to come to the table.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Have they been given a deadline?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Warren Christopher has been saying the same thing \\nand it hasn\\'t seemed to change the Serbs\\' behavior in the least.  Why \\nshould the Serbs take any heed of a threat to lift the arms embargo \\nwhen so far everything that\\'s been done has had no effect on the \\nfighting in Bosnia?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I just don\\'t accept the premise of \\nyour question.  It has had an effect; the embargo is having an \\neffect.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What effect?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  If the Serbians choose not to heed \\nour warnings, then they will face the consequences.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What effect has it had in Bosnia?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the effect that it has had on \\nthe Serbians, it has tightened up -- they are not getting their \\nshipments through.  We can brief more fully --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  In Bosnia, George.  In Bosnia what effect has it \\nhad?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, it\\'s hard to say if it\\'s \\nstopped the aggression to date.  That is why we\\'re continuing to \\npress for the Serbians to stop.  But we believe that over time we \\nwill continue to weaken the Serbs and that will have   an effect.  \\nI\\'m not saying it\\'s going to happen overnight; it clearly hasn\\'t \\nhappened overnight.  But we believe that over time the sanctions can \\nweaken the Serbs.  If it fails to work and if the Serbs fail to come \\nto the negotiating table, we\\'ll move forward with the embargo.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Isn\\'t there a working deadline, George, of the 24th \\n-- the same date as the U.N. -- the scheduled U.N. vote?  Hasn\\'t the \\nUnited States said, along with many of the other NATO allies, that if \\nthe Serbs aren\\'t willing to sign on to the peace accord by then, that \\nwe\\'ll seek -- haven\\'t we said that we will seek --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We\\'ve said continually we\\'re going \\nto --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  But on that deadline?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t have a specific date, but \\nwe\\'re going to move forward with the resolution, the U.N. resolution, \\nby around that time.  And if that fails to take effect, if that fails \\nto bring the Serbs to the table, we will clearly consider other \\nactions.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Isn\\'t this awfully incremental?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We\\'re taking a step-by-step \\napproach.  We\\'re ratcheting up the pressure and we\\'re going to \\ncontinue to do that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is there a possibility, George, that by the time \\nall these incremental steps are taken the Serbs will have achieved \\ntheir goals and then what\\'s the purpose?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think the purpose is to get the \\nSerbs to stop the aggression.  We are pursuing that goal on many \\ndifferent fronts.  We are pursuing it through the U.N.; we\\'re \\npursuing it through direct talks; we are pursuing it through \\ntightening the sanctions.  And we will consider lifting the arms \\nembargo.  We are turning the screws up on the Serbs and we will \\ncontinue to do that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  But if the efforts have been unsuccessful in \\ngetting the Serbs to stop the aggression how effective will any \\ncampaign be to have the Serbs give back what they\\'ve gained?  I mean, \\nonce they\\'re entrenched --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I can\\'t speculate on that.  We\\'re \\ngoing to continue to press for them to come to the table now.  We\\'re \\ngoing to continue to find ways to stop the aggression.  But I can\\'t \\nsee into the future.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, on the stimulus package, House Republicans \\nsay they\\'re going to hold a series of town meetings on Saturday to \\ntry and explain the details of your package.  They cite polls which \\nshow that the more people learn about it, the less they like it.  \\nWhat\\'s your strategy to counter that?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The strategy we have is the one \\nwe\\'re going to continue.  As you saw, the President today pointed up \\nthe very real benefits of the summer jobs program that this package \\nwill provide:  700,000 new summer jobs this summer for kids in inner \\ncities and suburbs to do productive work.  We are also going to point \\nout the benefits of the highway money, the investments in highways.  \\nWe\\'re going to point up the benefits of immunization.  We\\'re going to \\npoint up the benefits of Head Start.  We are going to say that the \\nRepublicans have a choice:  they can take action to create jobs or \\nthey can perpetuate the gridlock of the last four years. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Does it concern you, though, that the House now, \\nthe House Republicans are after you as well as the Senate?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The House Republicans voted against \\nit before.  They made a mistake then; they\\'re making a mistake now.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, does it strike anybody in the \\nadministration that it\\'s a bit strong to describe, as the President \\ndid this morning, the summer jobs program as -- quote -- \"a \\nreaffirmation of a promise of America\"?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not at all.  I think it\\'s the \\npromise of America to give kids a chance to reach their full \\npotential. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Government-funded jobs?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  To give people a chance to work?  \\nAbsolutely.  That is the promise of America.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  I want to follow up on something I asked yesterday \\n-- where does 700,000 summer jobs, where does that figure come from?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That is on top of.  I did look at \\nit.  There are currently 600,000 summer jobs in the pipeline.  This \\nwill be on top of the 600,000, so it will be a total of 1.3 million.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  The 700,000 would be created by the stimulus \\npackage?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Where does that number come from?  Because we\\'ve \\nbeen told all along that the stimulus package would create 500,000 \\nnew jobs.  And according to Panetta, that breaks down to something \\nlike 200,000 full-time jobs and 150,000 summer jobs.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes, but the summer -- that\\'s when \\nyou do their full-time equivalence.  I mean, 700,000 individuals will \\nreceive jobs this summer.  When you calculate it for the full-time \\njob effect, you have to do -- I don\\'t know what the exact formula is.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Seven hundred thousand part-time jobs --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  -- 150,000 or --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  One to four because it\\'s three months.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Thank you.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Can I follow up on that?  Did the President \\nmisspeak this morning when he said that some of the government money \\nfor these summer jobs will pay for private -- for kids to work in the \\nprivate sector?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not necessarily.  I mean, I think \\nthat there will be grants available.  That\\'s one of the ways that you \\npay for the jobs.  At the same time, he\\'s also issued a challenge to \\nthe private sector to hire kids on their own as well.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Tax dollars, for instance, would pay for kids to \\nwork at Time-Warner?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think the Time-Warner is actually \\nsomebody coming forward and actually doing a grant.  That\\'s going to \\nbe the bulk of it.  There could be isolated instances, though, where \\nthere would be grants to businesses.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Has the President spoken with any Senate \\nRepublicans this week?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  \\nNo, but there\\'s been a lot of contact with Senate Republicans in the \\nWhite House.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  At a lower level.  But the President hasn\\'t?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President has not, no.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Getting any closer to get the votes?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We\\'re continuing to work on it. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Anybody leaning your way?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  On Haiti, The New York Times seems to be reporting \\nsomething of a breakthrough in Aristide\\'s attitude towards the coup \\nleaders.  Can you confirm that there has been this change, and what \\nimpact will it have on the process?  And what did Pezzullo have to \\nsay yesterday in his report?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Pezzullo did brief the principals.  \\nI can\\'t confirm what\\'s actually happening in the talks.  I would \\nleave that to the negotiators themselves.  But Mr. Caputo has \\nreturned to Haiti.  We have received a briefing here at the White \\nHouse from Ambassador Pezzullo.  And as we have said time and time \\nagain, we believe that assurances of security are important to a \\nfinal resolution to a broader political settlement.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, yesterday you offered some selective \\nbreakdowns of how the stimulus would impact some states and cities.  \\nCan we get a complete breakdown by state of how these jobs would be \\nimpacted?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think we have it for most states, \\nyes.  And I think we can get it out.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Could you make that generally available?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I believe we can.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  And could you do it by the component of the \\nstimulus?  In other words --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t know if we can do -- I know \\nthat we can do it by summer jobs and other jobs.  I don\\'t know how \\ndeeply it can be broken down.  But clearly, we can break it down into \\nsummer jobs and other jobs.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  And can I follow up?  Is this the information that \\nJeff Eller and the rest of the White House is using in the ads in the \\nstates?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t know if they\\'re ads, but \\nthey\\'re press releases.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Can you describe what those press releases contain?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  All we\\'re doing is pointing out the \\nbenefits of this package to various states.  For instance, I know \\nthat today Senator Dole is heading up to Vermont and New Hampshire.  \\nAnd I would point out that the stimulus package, the jobs package \\ncreates 1,000 jobs in Vermont.  It creates 2,000 jobs in New \\nHampshire.  And the people of those states should remind him that \\nthis is important. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Where are the releases going?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They go to the states.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  To whom?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We can get them.  It\\'s no problem.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Can we get it?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Why don\\'t you put them out here as well?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think we can.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  This afternoon?  Would that be possible?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I\\'ll have to check.  I don\\'t know.  \\nBut as soon as we can.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Are you focusing these press releases on states \\nwhere there are moderate or pragmatic Republican senators?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think we\\'re trying to get as many \\nas we can.  It\\'s actually quite difficult to pull this together and \\nwe\\'re doing our best.  We\\'re putting them out as we get them.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Why are you so closely tracking Senator Dole\\'s \\nschedule?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I was just following it. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Are press releases going along to states where he\\'s \\nvisiting?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I\\'m not sure.  I think that \\nprobably there are press releases going to Vermont.  (Laughter.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Will there be a man in a chicken suit waiting?  \\n(Laughter.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, as the President goes about the business of \\ndefending what\\'s in his stimulus package, he doesn\\'t address what \\nseems to be the Republicans\\' main point, that you\\'re funding it with \\ndeficit spending rather than \"if it\\'s so important, why not come up \\nwith the funding for it\" seems to be the Republican argument.  And \\nhow do you answer that?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  What was answer is, we are paying \\nfor it over time.  And if you look at our budget, we pay for this \\npackage over time.  We believe right now the economy needs a jump-\\nstart for jobs.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  You\\'re not claiming, are you, that that doesn\\'t add \\nto the deficit this year?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I\\'m saying we\\'re paying for it over \\ntime.  I didn\\'t say that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  I know that, George.  But I mean, from the \\nbeginning, the question -- we do have annual budgets and things --\\ndeficit spending will pay for that this year, will it not?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  This year they clearly will.  But \\nover time our budget fully pays for this program.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What you\\'re saying is that there are savings that \\nwould cover this if it were this year in future years?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Absolutely.  That\\'s exactly what I \\nsaid.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  I know that, but there is going to be outstanding \\ndebt, it will add to the national debt from this year --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, we\\'re reducing the deficit by \\n$500 billion -- $514 billion over the next four years.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  You mean you\\'re reducing it below what it would \\nhave been?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Exactly.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  In fact, you\\'re adding a very large amount to the \\nnational debt over the period of --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  But we\\'re reducing it far more from \\nwhat it would have been.  That\\'s true.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Washington-type reduction.  (Laughter.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  You\\'re getting to be a grumpy old man.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, has any decision been made about the White \\nHouse or the President\\'s participation in the gay rights march coming \\nup in a week and a half?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We\\'re working on the President\\'s \\nschedule now.  I believe he\\'s going to be at the Senate Democratic \\nretreat in Jamestown that weekend.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Will he address it by phone?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t know about that.  It\\'s a \\nlittle far out, but I believe he\\'s going to be in the Senate retreat.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  So will he have the leaders in a day or two before \\nthe speech?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t know.

(Laughter.) \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     about the pace of appointments and says that \\nPresident Clinton is behind President Bush in the number of positions \\nthat people have been nominated for.  Are you going to speed up the \\npace of nominations or where do you stand with it?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We filled 814 of the President\\'s \\nappointments.  And it\\'s broken down -- we have 384 Schedule C; 147 \\nnoncareer SES; 213 PAS full-time.  I\\'m not sure what that means --\\n(laughter) -- 70 PA full-time.  And this is about the same -- it\\'s \\nabout the same pace of President Bush.  Obviously, as you move along \\nfarther, once you -- each level of appointment actually has a \\nmultiplier effect and frees up far more appointments.  So we expect \\nthe process to speed up.  But we\\'re at the pace of Bush.  Obviously \\nwe\\'d like to get these done as quickly as possible.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I would point out that the FBI background checks and the \\nbackground check is far more comprehensive and it takes more time \\nthan our predecessors, and that is part of the holdup.  But we\\'re \\nworking on it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is that because of Nannygate?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that\\'s an awful big part of \\nit, yes.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  In the story this morning, you were at \\napproximately the same pace as Bush in making appointments, but way \\nbehind in winning confirmations.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That\\'s where the background checks \\ncomes into play.  That\\'s the problem.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  That\\'s the background checks problem?  Because I \\nmean, you have a Democratic Senate --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, that\\'s not the -- you make the \\nappointments, and then it takes quite a bit of time to fill out all \\nthe forms and have the background checks done.  That\\'s exactly where \\nthe problem is.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What\\'s the President doing this afternoon, and \\nwhat\\'s on the plan for tomorrow?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR.

And then \\nhe\\'ll be -- tomorrow we\\'ll have an event, probably again focused on \\nthe stimulus and jobs package out of here at the White House.

Basically, you jam values\\ninto all the even bytes from SoundBase to SoundBase+0x170. This was\\nbecause\\nof how the Mac 128 (and some later machines) generated sound was by\\nscanning\\nthis block and D/Aing every even byte (the odd bytes went to the floppy on\\nsome machines).\\n\\nWhen the Mac II (and Apple Sound Chip) was invented, it was designed to\\ngenerate stereo sound. It was also designed to be compatible with we had\\nonce\\ndocumented. So storing bytes at the even values at SoundBase meant \"I\\nwant to\\nplay a mono sound\" and so it was emulated. But Apple had since retracted\\nthe\\ndocumentation on SoundBase and decided not to document the lowest layers\\nof\\nsound generation. So apple never explained where to stuff bytes if you\\nwant\\nto make stereo sound.\\n\\nEnter game developers. The sound driver and current sound manager are\\ninconveniently lame for making games. Furthermore, people who port from\\nthe\\nIBM don\\'t want to learn more APIs. So, it has become popular for game\\nwriters to write to SoundBase to make sound, since it is very easy.\\n\\nSince the Mac II, Apple has had many different kind of sound output\\nhardware,\\nand the only things they have in common are that writing to SoundBase\\nworks.\\nOn some hardware, (Mac II, IIx, IIcx, IIci at least), writing to SoundBase\\ngets you mono sound through both speakers. On some Macs (Quadra\\n700/900/950\\nat least) writing to SoundBase gets you mono sound on the left channel\\nonly.\\nBoth are technically correct interpretations of the original\\nspecification,\\nbut one is obviously preferable for asthetic reasons.\\n\\nIf developers use the Sound Manager (and I think the sound driver), mono\\nsounds will (typically) come out through both channels regardless of the\\nunderlying hardware. It is possible to specify you want to generate left\\nchannel only, but no one does. If developers write to sound base, their\\ngames will only come out the left on some games.\\n\\nThe other problem, the original Mac II only producing left channel sound\\non the internal speaker, while the SE/30 mixes both, isn\\'t really related.\\nIt is due to the post generation amplification used on the motherboards of\\nthe different machines. It only affects true stereo sounds. Sounds which\\nare actually mono, will play on the internal speaker, no matter what\\nmachine\\nyou have.\\n\\nNow, to more directly address the question, the games you list:\\nand also\\nHellcats,\\nSuper Tetris\\nOxyd\\n(and many more, these are just what I\\'ve tested)\\n\\nCheat and write to SoundBase and so are only left channel on Quadras.\\n\\n\\nOther games you list:\\nand also\\nPGA Tour Golf\\nCivilization\\n(and more, these are again only from personal experience)\\n\\nUse the sound manager and work fine on all machines.\\n\\nThe more of the story is to developers: DON\\'T CHEAT!\\nReally, I am absolutely, positively not allowed to do what I am about to\\ndo,\\nbut I\\'m going say it anyway.\\nStop cheating on sound!\\nReally soon, you will be sorry, as even those without external speakers\\nwill be disappointed with your sound on future hardware. The grace period\\nis about to end.\\nThe Sound Manager is understandable now, and works pretty well and will\\nwork\\neven better soon, so use it.\\n\\nIn conclusion:\\nTo Doug, it isn\\'t a hardware problem, at least, not a bug.\\nTo Jon, it isn\\'t a choice to developers as to whether they want to send\\nsound\\nto both channels. If they do it the right way, it is taken care of\\nautomatically. If you cheat, there is not way to make it work on all\\nhardware.\\n\\n\\nHave fun.\\n\\nDisclaimer number 1:\\nI don\\'t work on sound here at Apple, I\\'m just pretty well informed.\\nSo don\\'t write me with sound questions.\\n\\nDisclaimer number 2:\\nIf it says up above that I wrote anything like \"the grace period is about\\nto end\" then it is a bug in your news feed, since I am catagorically not\\nallowed to say anything like that.

If that's too steep,\\nyou can dump Thomas and Bagwell, replacing them with Paul Sorrento and\\na minimum wager to save a bit over a million dollars, and still have one\\nof the best teams in the majors.\\n\\np, Juan Guzman, 500\\np, Mussina,\\t400\\np, Castillo,    250\\np, Eldred,      175\\np, Rhodes,\\t155\\np, Militello,   118\\nrp, Rojas,\\t300\\nrp, Beck,\\t250\\nrp, Melendez,   235\\nrp, Hernandez,\\t185\\nrp, Nied,\\t150\\nc, Rodriguez,\\t275\\nc, Piazza,      126\\n1b, Thomas,\\t900\\n1b, Bagwell,    655\\n2b, Knoblauch,\\t500\\n2b, Barberie,\\t190\\n3b, Gomez,\\t312.5\\n3b, Palmer,\\t250\\nss, Listach,\\t350\\nss, Pena,\\t170\\nlf, Gonzalez,\\t525\\ncf, Lankford,\\t290\\nrf, R.Sanders,\\t275\\nof, Plantier,\\t245\",\n  '\\nIf you are looking for viewer try VPIC60',\n  \"\\n\\n     Would you say the same thing about the Dodgers in '65 or '66?  True,\\nCone is probably as good as Drysdale, and they have no Koufax, but still,\\nthese teams were winning with home run leaders who had very bad totals, with\\nlots of low-scoring games, etc.  And they didn't use relievers, whereas\\nJeff Montgomery is having a super season for them.\\n     That being said, I still picked them 5th or so, but I think a superb\\npitching team can win if they have enough hitting.  There's more of a\\nchance of that, I think, than of a team with tremendous hitting but no\\npitching.  At least, to me.\\n     I wonder, though - which one do you people think would do better - a team\\nwith Johnson, Koufax in his prime, Seaver, Carlton, and Young, in no real\\norder, as the starters, with Sutter, Fingers, and Lyle in the bullpen, but\\nwith a puny offense (assuming good defense, like Mazeroski, Maranville, etc.)\\nOr a team with poor pitching, but with an offense of Cobb, Carew, Ruth, Gehrig,\\nMays, Schmidt, Wagner, and Bench - again,you pick the order.\\n     I would postulate that the pitching one would be several games better by\\nseasons' end.  Even the best hitters can succeed only 2/5 of the time in\\ntheir best years, but a great pitcher can throw lots of shutouts - taking all\\nthe players in their prime, they might throw 50 shutouts in a year.  And all\\nthe offense would have to do is get 1 run across.\\n     I wonder if someone with Stratomatic or something could plug such all-\\ntime teams into a regular season, have it played, and report the results\\nI would love to see that.\",\n  'Here is the OPI (Offensive Production Index) for all NL players with at\\nleast 10 at-bats.\\n\\nIt is early in the season so there are some high numbers.

Since these programs are not meant for\\ncommercial or broadcast use, image quality is not critical.\\n\\nThe Digital Film system, for those of you who are uninitiated, is an A/B roll\\ndigitizing system on one $5000 JPEG compression card.  It was promoted as\\nan inexpensive online editing system with SVHS quality.  SuperMac, the maker\\nof the card, is trying to achieve this quality level, but as yet, has been\\nunable to deliver.  Our system produces \"near VHS\" quality at 30 fields per\\nsecond (640x480 overscan).  The card repeats every other field to get 60\\nfields per second.  This results in a kind of Super 8 film look that some\\nfind distracting.\\n\\nIf you can get past this problem, you\\'ll find the Adobe Premier editing \\nsoftware quite enjoyable with which to work.  It produces thousands of\\ndifferent effects from crystalize filters to DVE transitions to color matting.\\n\\nBecause of its non-linear nature, editing is fast and easy.  If you\\'ve ever\\nused (or seen used) an AVID or Montage system, you\\'ll recognize the methodology\\nand the user interface.\\n\\nThe total system with Quadra 950 (40Megs of RAM), 1 gig drive, 21\" Apple mon-\\nitor, Panasonic SVHS 1960 edit deck, audio gear (cassette, CD, EQ, mixer, etc),\\nComposite monitor, Digital Film card will set you back about $20,000.\\n\\nFor you video cowboys and girls, this system will not output at a quality\\nthat will satisfy most of your clients.

Which points to an anti-bias-against wrt\\nblacks.\\n\\nIn any case, for violent crimes and burglary and drug selling, blacks are\\nreported 53%, arrested 44%, and are present in jails/prisons 47% (1988).\\n\\nConsidering that 12% of the population is black, 6% are black males, and\\nsome percentage of that is out of the high/low age groups, we do have a\\nsituation where (if I remember my old calculations right) 4% of the\\npopulation commits almost half of the really nasty crimes.\\n\\nBlacks with similar histories (crime) to whites get the same sentences,\\nexcept in the South, where they receive around 20% less on paper!!\\n\\n\\n\\n-- \\nThere are actually people that STILL believe Love Canal was some kind of\\nenvironmental disaster.

Each year he's about\\n10 points below average.  And it's probably not just the park, since Terry\\nPendleton had excellent DAs in the three years before this.\\n\\nMoving back to second was a good idea.\\n\\nSo why is Hayes supposed to be good defensively?

Paddock, Times staff writer\\n \\n SAN FRANCISCO -- Police on Thursday served search warrants on the\\n Anti-Defamation League here and in Los Angeles, seizing evidence of a\\n nationwide intelligence network accused of keeping files on more than\\n 950 political groups, newspapers and labor unions and as many as\\n 12,000 people.\\n \\n Describing the spy operation in great detail, San Francisco\\n authorities simultaneously released voluminous documents telling how\\n operatives of the Anti-Defamation League searched through trash and\\n infiltrated organizations to gather intelligence on Arab-American,\\n right-wing and what they called \"pinko\" organizations.\\n \\n Representatives of the Anti-Defamation League, a well-known\\n organization in the U.S. Jewish community dedicated to fighting\\n anti-Semitism, declined detailed comment Thursday but denied breaking\\n any laws.\\n \\n Police allege that the organization maintains undercover operatives to\\n gather political intelligence in at least seven cities, including Los\\n Angeles and San Francisco.\\n \\n Groups that were the focus of the spy operation span the political\\n spectrum, including such groups as the Ku Klux Klan, the White Aryan\\n Resistance, Operation Rescue, Greenpeace, the National Assn. for the\\n Advancement of Colored People, the United Farm Workers and the Jewish\\n Defense League.  Also on the list were Mills College, the board of\\n directors of San Francisco public television station KQED and the San\\n Francisco Bay Guardian newspaper.\\n \\n People who were subjects of the spy operation included former\\n Republican Rep. Pete McCloskey, jailed political extremist Lyndon H.\\n LaRouche and Los Angeles Times foreign correspondent Scott Kraft, who\\n is based in South Africa.\\n \\n Authorities said much of the material collected by the groups was\\n confidential information obtained illegally from law enforcement\\n agencies.  They also alleged that data on some individuals and\\n organizations was sold separately to the South African government.\\n \\n In addition to allegations of obtaining confidential information from\\n police, the Anti-Defamation League could face a total of 48 felony\\n counts for not properly reporting the employment of its chief West\\n Coast spy, Roy Bullock, according to the affidavit filed to justify\\n the search warrant.\\n \\n The Anti-Defamation League disguised payments to Bullock for more than\\n 25 years by funneling $550 a week to Beverly Hills attorney Bruce I.\\n Hochman, who then paid Bullock, according to the documents released in\\n San Francisco.  Hochman, a former president of the Jewish Federation\\n Council of Greater Los Angeles and one of the state\\'s leading tax\\n attorneys, will be out of the city until late next week and could not\\n be reached for comment, his office said.\\n \\n Until 1990, Hochman, a former U.S. prosecutor, also was a member of a\\n panel appointed by then-Sen. Pete Wilson to secretly make initial\\n recommendations on new federal judges in California.  Hochman is a\\n former regional president of the Anti-Defamation League.\\n \\n The league, which initially cooperated with police, has denied\\n repeatedly that its intelligence-gathering operation broke any laws.\\n League officials will not confirm or deny whether Bullock was an\\n employee and have said they simply traded information with police\\n departments about people who might be involved in hate crimes.\\n \\n But in an affidavit filed to obtain warrants for Thursday\\'s searches,\\n San Francisco police alleged that \"ADL employees were apparently less\\n than truthful\" in providing information during an earlier search\\n conducted without a warrant.\\n \\n David Lehrer, executive director of the Los Angeles ADL office, said\\n the organization has not violated the law.  \"There is nothing\\n nefarious about how we operate or what we have done,\" he said.  \"Our\\n record speaks for itself.\"\\n \\n The police affidavit contends that Lehrer had sole control of a secret\\n fund used to pay for \"fact-finding operations.\"  Lehrer, according to\\n the documents, signed checks from the account under the name L.\\n Patterson.\\n \\n An ADL official said the account was used to pay for subscriptions to\\n a wide variety of extremist publications that might balk at sending\\n them directly to the Anti-Defamation League.\\n \\n Bullock, 58, who has been collecting intelligence for the ADL for\\n nearly 40 years, defended his efforts during a lengthy interview with\\n San Francisco police.  He said that he gathered names from many\\n sources and entered them into his computer under headings such as\\n \"Skins\" and \"Pinkos,\" but that did not necessarily mean that they were\\n under surveillance.\\n \\n \"I might never see or call up on 99% of them again,\" Bullock said.\\n \"And it doesn\\'t mean anything that they\\'re in the files.  It\\'s not a\\n threat to anyone\\'s civil rights that a name appears in my files under,\\n say, \\'Pinko.\\'\"\\n \\n In recent years, Bullock worked closely with San Francisco Police\\n Officer Tom Gerard, who fled to the Phillippines last fall after he\\n was questioned by the FBI in the case.\\n \\n A former CIA employee, Gerard supplied Bullock with criminal records\\n and Department of Motor Vehicles information such as home addresses,\\n vehicle registration, physical characteristics and drivers license\\n photographs.\\n \\n Using files gathered for the Anti-Defamation League, Gerard and\\n Bullock also provided information to the South African government,\\n receiving $16,000 over four years, the documents show.\\n \\n The file on Times staff writer Kraft, which was apparently sold to the\\n South African government, provides some insight into the hit-and-miss\\n nature of the spy operation.\\n \\n The file notes that Kraft\\'s articles \"appear frequently in The Times\\n and are well researched and written,\" but little else about the file\\n is accurate.  The brief entry confuses The Times\\' Kraft with another\\n Scott Kraft and provides the South African government with the wrong\\n Kraft\\'s physical description, photograph and other personal\\n information.\\n \\n Nevertheless, the documents provide illuminating details of how\\n Bullock for decades infiltrated all manner of organizations, from\\n skinheads to left-wing radicals, searching regularly through the trash\\n of target groups.  Using Anti-Defamation League funds, he also ran his\\n own paid informants under code names such as \"Scott\" and \"Scumbag.\"\\n \\n He worked closely with police officers up and down the coast,\\n exchanged information with the FBI and worked with federal agencies,\\n including the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.\\n \\n It was Bullock\\'s work as a paid informant for the FBI -- while spying\\n on behalf of the Anti-Defamation League and the South African\\n government -- that proved his undoing. The FBI learned that he was an\\n agent of a foreign government and began investigating, leading to the\\n probe of the Anti-Defamation League\\'s intelligence network.  The\\n Anti-Defamation League employed undercover operatives to gather\\n information in Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York, Washington,\\n Chicago, St. Louis and Atlanta, according to the affidavit and\\n investigators.  Joining San Francisco police in searching league\\n offices and a Los Angeles bank were investigators from the office of\\n San Francisco Dist. Atty. Arlo Smith and the state Franchise Tax\\n Board.  The Los Angeles Police Department, which earlier refused to\\n cooperate with the investigation, was informed of the searches in Los\\n Angeles but not invited to participate.  Investigators suspect that\\n some confidential information in the Anti-Defamation League files may\\n have come from Los Angeles police officers.\\n \\n \\n \\n From Los Angeles Times, Saturday, April 10, 1993.

Arlo Smith said that Anti-Defamation\\n League employees involved in intelligence gathering could face many\\n felony counts of receiving confidential files, eavesdropping, tax\\n violations and conspiracy.\\n \\n Police have accused the Anti-Defamation League of not being truthful\\n about its spying operations, which collected information on more than\\n 12,000 individuals and 950 political groups across the political\\n spectrum.\\n \\n Hundreds of pages of documents released by prosecutors Thursday show\\n that the ADL maintained a nationwide intelligence network and kept\\n files on political figures.\\n \\n Even so, Smith suggested that if the Anti-Defamation League shut down\\n its spy operation, prosecutors would take that into account when\\n deciding what charges to file.\\n \\n In a statement released in Washington, National Director Abraham H.\\n Foxman described the ADL as \"a Jewish defense agency which has fought\\n to protect all minorities from bigotry and discrimination for 80\\n years.\"\\n \\n Foxman said the organization is regarded as a credible source on\\n extremist groups and has a tradition of routinely providing\\n information to police, journalists, academics, government officials\\n and the public.  It has never been the policy of the ADL to obtain\\n information illegally, he said.\\n \\n \"Like other journalists, in order to protect the confidentiality and\\n physical safety of its sources, ADL will not comment on the nature or\\n identity of any source of information,\" Foxman said.\\n \\n The Anti-Defamation League refused to acknowledge that one of its\\n longtime employees, Roy Bullock, was anything more than \"a private\\n individual who is alleged to be an ADL \\'informant.\\'\"\\n \\n Among the documents released by prosecutors were detailed statements\\n showing how the ADL funneled weekly payments to Bullock through\\n Beverly Hills attorney Bruce I. Hochman.\\n \\n \"Roy would penetrate organizations and needed this arrangement to be\\n distanced from ADL,\" Hochman told a San Francisco police investigator.\\n Hochman could not be reached Friday at his home or office for comment.\\n \\n Despite the Anti-Defamation League\\'s assertion that it will cooperate\\n with authorities, San Francisco police said the group did not turn\\n over all pertinent documents during a voluntary search of the group\\'s\\n offices in Los Angeles and San Francisco last fall.\\n \\n A second round of searches Thursday, this time with search warrants,\\n produced a vast quantity of records, primarily dealing with financial\\n transactions, Smith said.  Further searches may be necessary and it\\n will be at least a month before any charges are filed, he said.\\n \\n \"The investigation, of course, will go wherever the facts lead us,\"\\n the district attorney said.',\n  '} In article &lt;1993Apr14.175545.3528@alleg.edu&gt;, millits@yankee.org (Sam\\n} \\n} i\\'m telling you, sam, three l\\'s.  call up mom and ask.\\n} \\n} bob vesterman.\\n} \\nyeah, and in case even that isn\\'t enough to prompt boy genius\\n\"Sam\" to pick up a paper and see how \"his\" name is spelled,\\nhere\\'s another hint: the single \"L\" comes between the two \"I\"s...',\n  '\\nI think he just wanted to get Henneman some work, because the \\nTigers had days off both the day before and the day after.',\n  \"\\nYah.

Well, I now have the\\nopportunity to write some font rendering software so I would like to have\\nsome of my questions answered before I jump into the deep end.\\n\\nThe main problem I face is how to use the even/odd or non-winding rules to\\nturn the outlines into a single outline polygon (my renderer can handle\\ncomplex polygons so there is no need to reduce the polygons to simple\\npolygons). For example, in the letter \"O\" there are two outlines:\\n\\n\\t1) The outside outline which is clockwise (TrueType font)\\n\\t2) The inside outline which is counterclockwise.\\n\\nOne common solution used by a number of rendering packages is to simply \\nconnect the inner outline to the outer outline at the point where the\\ntwo outlines are closest. This is equivalent to descibing a \"polygon with\\nholes\". The renderer will then make the appropriate hole since the interior\\npolygon edges are in the opposite direction to the outside edges.\\n\\nI do not want to use this simplistic system since:\\n\\n\\t1) It will not handle all outline fonts properly (it is not a simple\\n\\t\\tmatter to connect the outer outline to the inner outline for\\n\\t\\tsome fancy fonts).\\n\\t2) It does not properly handle the even/odd or non-winding rules.\\n\\nFrom my research over the years the proper solution is to use a trapezoid\\ndecomposition algorithm to scan convert the outlines into trapezoids (as\\nis done by the Postscript and TrueType font rasterizers). These trapezoidal\\npolygons can then be easily and properly rendered by the 3D scanline renderer.\\n\\nMy question is: are there any better solutions to turning the outlines into\\npolgyons other than the trapezoid decomposer? I am not fond of this solution\\nsince it creates excess number of polygons.\\n\\nAnother question, for those in the know: what is the best algorithm to create\\nbevelled and/or offset curves for font outlines?

It seems to me that he is arguing\\nfor LESS imposition of the federal government into religion.\\n\\nNice job on the specificity of that one, too.\\n\\n\\n\\n[Analysis of historical/modern communication media deleted] \\n\\n\\nAh yes, it is a conspiracy of profound proportions.  Methinks that you\\nmay be a bit resentful of Mr. Limbaugh\\'s success because you attribute it\\nprimarily to luck (how, after all, could anyone with profound differences\\nof opinion from yourself have become successful without the operation of\\nconspiracy or blind luck!)  Do you feel this same level of knee-jerk\\nresentment against lottery winners, or do you congratulate them on their\\ngood fortune?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis should be great fun, since it is the Liberal movement in America\\nthat is pushing the hardest for centralized fascist control of The People\\nand business (government/business \\'partnership\\' indeed), and Mr. Limbaugh \\nis the populist nemesis of that movement.\\n\\nI have read Mr. Limbaugh\\'s book, and although it was not the most literary\\npiece I have read in recent memory it certainly did not contain \"venom\"\\nat all, let alone \"venom\" comparable to an individual who callously murdered\\nmillions out of racism.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA very serious tone in that oratory.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYou neglect to mention that Mr. Limbaugh (have you ever listened to his show, \\nBTW?) continuously encourages his audience to think for themselves rather\\nthan blindly following any media icon, himself included.  You yourself mention \\nthat he makes no bones about his show being strictly about his own opinions.\\nHe also adopts a rather satirical approach, and presumes his audience to be\\nintelligent enough to distinguish satire from seriousness (and he says as much).\\nThis is in contrast to the average mass-media show, in which the audience is\\ntreated as society\\'s intellectual lowest common denominator.\\n\\nI am sure that Adolf Hitler was a master of satire; I am sure he was just\\nkidding when he said that the Jews were the cause of Germany\\'s problems and\\nneeded to be exterminated.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis is not religion, it is clearly a perverse worship of race.  Since\\nChrist was a Jew, it seems quite unlikely that Hitler\\'s characterization of\\nthe Aryan as \"the highest image of the Lord\" fits with Christian doctrine.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPrivate religious schools have a vastly better record of success than\\npublicly funded schools.  American history is indeed primarily Judeo-\\nChristian.  I suppose that Mr. Limbaugh pointing out facts is equivalent\\nto Adolf Hitler worshiping the Aryan race.  I think you might be reaching\\njust a wee bit here.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDefinite suggestion that the government should control the entertainment\\nindustry here.\\n\\n\\n\\nJust a guess here, but I don\\'t think that Mr. Limbaugh would advocate\\ngovernment control of Hollywood.  You should perhaps call his radio show\\nto confirm this.  I believe this is more a criticism of Hollywood and the\\ndepraved moral values it espouses, not an advocation of government control \\nof Hollywood.\\n\\n90\\'s Liberals, on the other hand, want to have complete government control \\nof our school systems, so that the government can teach The People at an\\nearly age the \"right\" way to view religion and morality.  I believe Mr. \\nLimbaugh is against this, as his satirical use of the \"young heads full\\nof mush\" hyperbole indicates.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPretty strong conspiracy theory insinuated here, with an implicit plea for\\ngovernment power to be used to break up the conspiracy.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIndication here that \"Elements of the Media\" (since career is a self-selected\\ncategorization, perhaps an inferred \\'larger percentage than represented in\\nthe populace at large\\') has a leftist bias.  Doesn\\'t sound too unreasonable.\\nNo insinuation that CNN should not report in an objective fashion, only\\nthat for reporters to say that they do not have any personal bias in the\\nsituation is disingenuous to megalomaniacal.\\n\\nYou may disagree, and it may well be exagerrated, but it is not an unreasonable \\nopinion; and Mr. Limbaugh goes well out of his way to make sure that his \\naudience knows that these are his opinions, unlike most other reporting that \\npurports to achieve perfect objectivity but in actuality will in some degree \\nor other, in a statistical sense, reflect the biases of the reporters.  Who \\nis being disingenuous here, Mr. Shaw or Mr. Limbaugh?\\n\\nAgain, you should ask Mr. Limbaugh himself, but I expect that he would\\noppose government control of the media.\\n\\n\\n\\n        \\n\\nIt is indeed depressing to see such myopia and tiresome Liberal arrogance.\\nLiberals love to play games with paradigms as a way of discrediting people\\nwho disagree with them.  Why don\\'t you challenge conservative ideology\\non an intellectual level rather than engaging in ludicrous comparisons?\\nPerhaps the underpinnings of your ideology are intellectual only in that\\nthey exist in your mind, not the real world.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPerhaps there are a few among the intellectually challenged who percieve\\nRush Limbaugh as a hate-monger, but in my experience he has been spreading\\nlaughter at the ludicrous self-importance of the Left, not hatred.\\n\\nAs to Mr. Bush, you may be correct about his fascist economic leanings.\\nMr. Reagan, on the other hand, did his best to reverse the fascist trend\\nof government involvement in business.  Mr. Clinton is increasing fascism\\nin America through \"business/government partnership\" and increased levels\\nof taxation.  Perhaps you should not have skipped your vocabulary classes\\nin grade school.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHmmm.  Seems to me that Limbaugh is not in any way comparable to Hitler\\nbecause he has not murdered six million Jews and many, many others out of\\nracism.  I come from a mixed-race family, so I am quite well attuned to\\nracism; I don\\'t hear any coming from Rush Limbaugh.  The only place I hear \\nracism coming from these days and being taken seriously is from the Liberal \\nLeft.\\n\\nThe Liberal Left is the movement I see trying to get America hooked\\non the opiates of Socialized Medicine, Socialized Transportation, Socialized\\nEducation, etc.  The Left already has America hopelessly addicted to \\nthat Liberal drug, the Social Security Chain Letter.  It is quite clear\\nto me that while the Hitler analogy does not really apply to either Rush \\nLimbaugh or William Jefferson Clinton, if one of the two is closer than \\nthe other it is clearly the Fascist Clinton.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis is the same address as \"Idiots Anonymous\", isn\\'t it?\\n\\n\\nMatt Freivald\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nLiBORGalism:\\n             THINKING IS IRRELEVANT.

I believe all of the\\npeople mentioned here deserve the hall of fame more than Dave Kingman does. I\\nfeel they were all much better players. I am not saying I fell they deserve to\\ngo but that they would deserve it more. \\n\\nIMHO \\nDave Kingman - definately not. They guy only had a couple of years were he\\ncould hit with atleast a respectable averag. The rest of his career I do not\\nthink he was very feared by pitchers. I also do not think he did a lot for the\\ngame. I mean really I am a Met fan - he was a Met for part of his career and I\\nstill would not back him for the Hall of Fame.\\n\\nDave Winfield - I think so. He is feared by pitchers, he has had several\\nseason where he hit for a respectable average and his production numbers are\\n(in my opinion - without stats) better than Kingman's (probably by quite a\\nbit). I also perceive him to be a leader, maybe not as much as some other\\npeople but none the less a leader. I think he has made substantial\\ncontributions to the game of baseball and to society. Examples of this are\\nsome of the charitable things he has done (I know some of this from when he\\nwas with the Yankees). I think he the type of player that kids can look up to\\nand while this is definately not the only criteria for the Hall of Fame I\\nthink it deserves some consideration.\\n\\nLee Smith - Maybe, I would have to see his stats again but he definately would\\ndeserve to go before the likes of Kingman.\\n\\nDarrell Evans - No.\\n\\nEddie Murray - Maybe, He has had a very good career, he is a leader (although\\na silent one), he is a good role model. Are the stats good enough? I am not\\nsure - but I would once again believe they are much better than Kingman's both\\nthe average as well as the power numbers (but not as good as Winfield's). Just\\nthink, Eddie did not have as much publicity for most of his great years.\\n\\nJeff Reardon - My guess is no, but it kind of depends on his numbers. Off the\\ntop of my head I would take Lee Smith first.\\n\\n\\nWell, I strongly disagree here. Both of these guys deserve it for sure. I\\ntalked about leadership above, both of these guys are leaders and have been\\ninstumental in leading their teams to the post season. Robin does have very\\ngood offensive numbers both average and power and Ozzie has okay numbers\\noffensively. The difference with Ozzie is that if you gave him a home run for\\nevery run he saved by making an incredible play at shortstop - he would have\\nshattered Aaron's home run mark by now. How many of those great plays saved\\ngames? How many of those great plays motivated his team to rally and win a\\ngame? While I believe both of these guys have numbers, baseball is about more\\nthan numbers (or at least winning at baseball is about more than numbers).\\nBoth of these guys are proven stars and belong in the Hall of Fame. As does\\nGeorge Brett who also belongs in this class of player.\\n\\n\\nSteve Garvey - I am not sure, probably not but I guess I could see someone\\nmaking a case for him. \\n\\nJack Morris - Once again not my first choice but I can see why someone might\\nbring up his name.\\n\\nKirby Puckett - Probably. The only reason I do not say definately is he still\\nhas time left in his career. If he continues doing what he has been then my\\nprobably will turn into a definately.\\n\\nNolan Ryan - Is there really any doubt? I think I heard something about him\\nhaving some 53 records (maybe they were not all good - I don't know I did not\\nhear any of them just the number). He has the numbers, he has the\\ncontributions to the game and community and he is a great role model. I would\\nnot say that he is the best pitcher to ever pitch the game (probably not even\\ntop 20) but he would be the first pitcher I would put in the Hall of Fame\\nbecause of his accomplishments (no-hitters, strikeouts, respectable numbers -\\neven with some weaker teams) you can go on and on.

If WOD is working, as we\\'re led to believe, then drug\\nabuse should have gone down substantially by now.  The reality\\nis, is that it has not gone down very much.  If anything,\\nsubstance abuse is on the rise.  I\\'m also going to supply a\\npossible solution to this problem.\\n\\nThe following text is an excerpt from an article about rock music\\nand pot entitled \"Hello Again, Mary Jane\" which appears in the\\ncurrent issue of Time magazine (April 19, 1993, p. 59).\\n\\n    Law-enforcement officials say pot advocates are just blowing\\n    smoke when they talk about the comeback of the weed.  \"Perhaps\\n    because of the change of administrations, the marijuana lobby\\n    is out in full force,\" says Robert Bonner, head of the Drug\\n    Enforcement Administration.  \"The fact is, they\\'re losing the\\n    battle.\"  In 1985 more than 23% of youths ages 12 to 17 said\\n    they smoked marijuana; in 1991 that figure was 13%, and Bonner\\n    says it is still falling.  Bonner also offers a reminder that\\n    studies confirm such marijuana health risks as destruction of\\n    nerve cells in the brain and lung damage.\\n\\nThe chart that follows was taken from the Wednesday, April 14, 1993\\nissue of USA Today (\"Drug Use Up Among U.S. Eigth-graders\" by Mike\\nSnider, p. 6D).\\n\\n    Adolescents\\' choices\\n\\n    Drugs used by eighth graders in the last month:\\n                      Estimated, per 100 students\\n                             1991     1992   Pct. chg.\\n    Alcohol                  25.1     26.1        +4%\\n    Cigarettes               14.3     15.5        +8%\\n    Marijuana                 3.2      3.7       +16% \\n    Amphetamines              2.6      3.3       +27%\\n    LSD                       0.6      0.9       +50%\\n    Cocaine                   0.5      0.7       +40%\\n    Crack                     0.3      0.5       +67%\\n\\n    Source:  University of Michigan Institute for Social Research,\\n    1993 report\\n\\nWe are not winning the \"war on drugs\".  I think you can see that one\\nof the tactics that the DEA employs to give people the impression that\\nthe \"war on drugs\" is being won is to selectively quote statistics---\\nonly statistics that support their contention that drug use has gone\\ndown.  The excerpt from Time magazine that I included in this post is\\nan excellent example of how organizations like the DEA attempt to\\ndeceive the public.\\n\\nUsage of *one* particular drug may have gone down but at the same\\ntime usage of other drugs may have gone *up* (a.k.a. substitution).\\nAlso, drug usage among *one* particular age group may have gone down\\nbut drug usage among another age group may have gone *up*.  Therefore,\\nif one takes a look at the big picture, taking into consideration *all*\\nthe statistics, then it\\'s obvious that the so-called \"war on drugs\" is\\nbeing lost.  Perhaps the drug war is being won as far as illegal drugs\\ngo, but if one factors in alcohol abuse, smoking, and use of inhalants,\\nthen the magnitude of the drug problem in this country can then placed\\nin its true perspective.\\n\\nFor those of you who don\\'t consider alcohol to be a drug then try\\ndrinking a fifth of whiskey sometime and then come back and tell me\\nthat it\\'s not a drug.  Agencies like the DEA only go after *illegal*\\ndrugs.  This is one of the reasons why the drug war is a fruitless\\nattempt at preventing substance abuse---people will merely switch to\\nanother drug if the one they were using becomes scarce or unpopular.\\n\\nThe solution to the drug abuse problem in this country may be to\\nlegalize some---not all---drugs whose toxicity has been shown to be\\nwithin reasonable limits (you won\\'t drop dead after using it a few\\ntimes) and then couple this with a massive drug education program.\\nThe reason why I think legalization is *part* of the solution is\\nbecause people seem to be able to easily obtain drugs despite the\\ngovernment\\'s efforts to the contrary---the money spent on drug\\ninterdiction could be spent more effectively elsewhere (e.g., drug\\neducation).  Additionally, legalization would reduce crime because\\nthe profit motive would be taken out of drug trafficking which often\\ngoes along with other kinds of crime.  Not to mention the fact that\\naddicts would have less reason to prey on innocent people for their\\nmoney and posessions in order to support their expensive habit;\\nlegalization would cause the street price of drugs to fall\\nsubstantially so drugs would be much more affordable to addicts.\\n\\nIMHO, the way to reduce substance abuse is to do to drugs what has been\\ndone to smokers:  make drug use socially unacceptable rather than try to\\nemploy heavy-handed law enforcement and punish people by incarcerating\\nthem.  As you already know, people in the U.S. smoke a lot less than\\nthey used to.  This reduction in the number of smokers has been brought\\nabout by public awareness campaigns, laws restricting where people can\\nlight up, warning labels on cigarette packages, taxation on tobacco in\\norder to reduce consumption, and so on.  I propose that similar methods\\nbe used to reduce substance abuse after legalization has been carried\\nout.  They are as follows:\\n\\n    * Drugs being sold must come with clear, concise information which\\n      states the possible health hazzards involved with using this\\n      product and recommendations on how the drug should be used.\\n      Things like dosage levels and how long the drug should be used\\n      ought to accompany the packaging the drug is contained in.\\n\\n    * All drugs should be taxed at a rate that generates a lot of\\n      revenue but not so high as to encourage people to acquire drugs\\n      through illegal channels.  Part of the revenue collected from\\n      drug taxes should be used to fund drug education and law\\n      enforcement.\\n\\n    * Make it a felony to sell drugs to minors (people under the age of\\n      18).  Anyone can sell drugs but they must not dodge paying the\\n      taxes on drugs or sell drugs with the warning information absent.\\n      Failure to pay the appropiate taxes on drugs or omitting warning\\n      information should also be a felony.\\n\\n    * Establish a government agency whose job is to insure that the\\n      purity and safety of all drugs is as high as possible.  This\\n      agency would try to prevent people from getting a hold of bad\\n      drugs---something that is a fairly serious problem now.\\n\\nI\\'m sure that many of the things I\\'ve discussed in this article have\\nbeen hashed out before in this newsgroup.  Nevertheless, I thought\\nit was a good idea to give my two cents (actually a buck and a half...)\\nall at once so you could get a good idea of where I currently stand on\\nWOD.  Go ahead and tear into my post; I\\'m sure there is something in it\\nthat you may wish to take a different view on or flame. :) :) :)  BTW,\\nI posted the articles from USA Today to not only help prove my\\nassertions but also to provide information on LSD usage among youths---\\nsomething which I noticed some posters to this group were interested in.\\n\\nScott Kennedy,  Brewer and Patriot',\n  \"Hi.

Thanks to eck@panix.com (Mark Eckenwiler) and\\nthf2@kimbark.uchicago.edu (Ted Frank), my account is to be axed.\\nI guess that the information I am presenting is just toooo difficult\\nfor them to deal with. They (ONLY Ted and Mark) have complained to my\\nsysadmin some unknown number of times to get me off the net. (In his\\ndefense, Mark sent only one message and it was not THAT bad; it has\\nbeen posted in one of the newsgroups; However, it *was* not directed\\nat me as would be common practice and I am VERY good at responding\\nvia netmail...)\\n\\nWhile I disagree with Ted, I would not send mail to his sysadmin\\nto get him axed. Name-calling was not enough; jumping on every post\\nI made was not enough; ignoring specific points when they were not\\nwhat the desired picture was not enough; SIMPLY IGNORING ME IF I\\nAM SUCH A KOOK WAS NOT ENOUGH. Even now I do not wish to have him\\naxed, but I do wish to express my disgust about this. \"Argumentum\\nad silence-your-opponent-um\"?! I would have thought he would have\\nwanted me to stay around just to have someone to yell about and\\nseem sooo wise... (to himself, I think).\\n\\nThe issue that seems to be: \"Is the following an advertisement?\"\\nApparently, Ted and Mark think so...\\n\\n1) I Posted an article from around one year ago as it was taken \\n\\t*off the net* from last year. If reposting an article\\n\\tconstitutes posting an ad, then I am guilty. This post\\n\\tdid have a name and address and, yes, a price. If one\\n\\thad posted the address and subscription price of \"Newsweek\",\\n\\twould that be an ad? I get nothing from showing this stuff.\\n2) I Posted a list of documents showing examples of the kind of\\n\\t\"proof\" that was REQUESTED BY TED FRANK. He then complains\\n\\tto my sysadmin saying that I am advertising and, lo and\\n\\tbehold, \"poof\", there goes my account. This one had an\\n\\taddress in it! Oh, no! I Guess that means it is an ad!\\n\\nIf you value the alternative view I have been discussing, or VALUE\\nITS DISCUSSION even if you do not agree with it, I ask that you send\\na note saying as much to me to show to the sysadmin. They rarely get\\n\"Ya know, that user on your net was real helpful...\" or whatever; they\\nonly get \"I don\\'t like what that user is doing because...\".\\nPlease do not send the note to the sysadmin. I need to take it to them\\nin a manner that has at least a chance of getting through.\\n\\nIn my files here are hundreds of responses from people saying \"Thanks for\\nthe info\" or \"Could you send me such and such?\" or \"Your posts are\\nvery interesting... keep it up.\" and only a handfull of \"Go aways\". But,\\nI guess the fact that I have decided not to waste my time trying to\\nconvince Ted is a Net Offense[TM] of such magnitude as to warrant\\na message complaining about me. (Knock, knock...\"My name is Ted and\\nand this is Mark... We\\'re from the thought police. Seems you have\\nsome pretty dangerous ideas here, and we\\'re here to confiscate them...\")\\nNWO Indeed!\\n\\nGuess I will have to go back to the drawing board and come up with\\na new plan... Thanks Ted and Mike. Hope you are happy.\\nI will be on for a few more days and then... that\\'s all folks!\\nYour comments and support are requested. I can no longer post\\nto news. I ask what this has accomplished... Is there some benefit\\nfrom making alternative views simply vanish? Not in my book. \\nSeems the easiest way to win an argument is to make the opposing side\\nshut up. Images of Waco.... ah, but alas... And all this when I am in the\\nprocess of typing in a letter to me from the Tax Collector saying that\\na lien was removed due to a letter that I wrote challenging jurisdiction.\\nOh, well... It takes time to come up with the info requested, and I\\nwas just getting started.\\n\\nIt should be noted that Ted Frank has been accused publicly over 40\\ntimes of being an NWO supporter and has never made an statements to the\\ncontrary. Further, what ARE Ted Frank\\'s motivations for getting me axed?\\nWe all know that SOME PEOPLE are getting paid to collect info on people\\non the net that are of \"interest\" to the government, and Ted sure seems\\nto have a *personal* interest in debunking me. Hmmm... just who does\\nhe work for? The University of Chicago which he \"attends\"(?) is well\\nknown as one of the biggest NWO supporters...\\n\\nAnd finally, if anyone would be able to help me find a new account here\\nin the Boulder/Denver area, I would greatly appreciate it. I am in the\\nprocess of installing Linux and so will be able to do UUCP or maybe\\na TC/IP connection. Any help here would be greatly appreciated.

This would a form of equality that would be skewed\\ntoward poorer people.\\n\\nIn fact, most anti-gay bashing laws are constructed to offer equal \\nprotection. They make it an offense to damage people based on a \\nmotivation of hatred for sexual orientation. Thus the law in its\\nimpartial majesty protects hets as well as gays from being bashed.\\nI\\'m sure that\\'s a great relief to Douglas Meier.\\n\\n\\n',\n  \"\\nWow.  ESPN can repeat eleven-year-old Bill James research.  (Literally.\\nCheck the 1982 Abstract.)  \\n\\n\\nPerhaps in 2004 they'll be as reliable as an average SDCN.\\n\\n\\nOops, maybe not.\",\n  'Philadelphia at Chicago:  Teams tied for 1st after Sunday\\n     Dick Redding battled Chet Brewer in the first game of a dramatic four\\ngame series.  One Friday, one Saturday, and a good-old Sunday doubleheader.\\n\"What could be better,\" declared Ernie Banks.  Perhaps the fact that the Cubs\\nare challenging?\\n     \"It\\'s pitching, it\\'s always been pitching that we\\'ve lacked,\" announced\\nRyne Sandberg.  \"If we can get by Brewer, then beat Carlton, Alexander, or\\nBunning - preferrably 2 of the last three - we\\'ll know we might be able to\\nwin.\\n     \"Lord, I hope we pull it off.\"\\n     The Phils scored once in the top of the first; Richie Ashburn singled, Pete\\nRose followed with a hit, sending Ashburn around second.  Kiki Cuyler cut\\nthe ball off in left center, and threw a bullet in to Ernie Banks, who threw\\nto Ron Santo to get Ashburn at third.  Rose went to second on the play.\\n     Christobel Torrienti lifted a long fly to center, moving Pete Rose to\\nthird.  Schmidt was walked - the Cubs were absolutely refusing to let him\\nbeat them.  Both Torrienti and Schmidt will likely draw 130-150 walks this\\nyear.  Chuck Klein is starting to hit very well, and he lashed a double into a\\ngap in right-center.  \"Cool Papa\" Bell\\'s speed allowed him to cut the ball off\\nand prevent Schmidt from scoring.  Nellie Fox was walked, and Bob Boone\\ngrounded out to second, ending the threat.  \\n     \"Teams are starting to realize that you don\\'t have to pitch to Schmidt or\\nTorrienti, and that is lowering their run total.  It puts a lot of pressure on\\nKlein and Dick Allen (who platoons with Chuck Klein and occasionally spells\\nRose at first), and it\\'s a credit to the Phillies that they\\'ve been able to\\nsustain their pace.  The picthers have slumped at times.\"  So came the\\nanalysis from Frank Chance.\\n     The Cubs got that run back when Bell bunted for a hit, Thomas\\' grounder\\nmoved him to second, and - after Sandberg made out - Billy Williams singled\\nhome a run.  In the sixth, Ron Santo launched a two-run homer to make it\\n3-1.  Dick Redding got in trouble in the eighth, as Schmidt singled and Klein\\nsingled him to third.  Ed Reulbach entered to face Fox, but Dick Allen popped\\nout of the dugout to hit.  Allen doubled to right, but luckily for the Cubs,\\nWilliams had moved to left and Andre Dawson had been inserted for defense.\\nHe fired a bullet to home plate to keep Klein at third.  Lance Parrish, hitting\\nfor Boone, was walked, and Bruce Sutter entered.  Larry Bowa grounded into\\na 1-2-3 double play, but Ed Delahanty walked as a pinch-hitter.  Desiring a\\nstrikeout, since Ashburn was likely to attempt a bunt hit with the quick\\nTrillo pinch-running at third, Chance brought in Lee Smith, who induced a\\npop-up to the catcher from the speedy centerfielder, ending the inning.  The\\nCubs took the win, 3-2, moving a game behind the Phillies.\\n     Steve Carlton was called upon to battle 3-Finger Brown Saturday.  To get\\nanother righthander in the lineup, Ron Santo moved to first and Bill Madlock\\nplayed third.  Unfortunately, Brown allowed six doubles, and the Cub bullpen\\nwas worn down even more, as the Cubs tried to maintain a lead against\\nLefty.  Madlock, batting sixth, had knocked two doubles of his own, driving\\nhome four runs.  Gabby Hartnett hit two home runs, and Cuyler added\\nanother, and the score was 8-6, Cubs after six innings.  The Phillie bullpen\\nhad more troubles in the bottom of the eighth, as the Cubs grabbed 3 more\\nruns to ice an 11-7 triumph.\\n     Sunday\\'s twin bill saw Cool Papa Bell gather seven straight hits at one\\npoint, including a rare outside-the-park home run in the second game, off\\nRobin Roberts.  Grover Alexander of the Phils took the first contest, 4-2, but\\nthe Cubs captured the second one 5-4, with Waddell gaining the win.  Bruce\\nSutter tossed two innings for the save, though he allowed one run in the\\neighth.  The Cardinals stood half a game behind these co-leaders, and would\\nconclude their series with the Expos on Monday.\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\\n     Montreal at St. Louis(August 3-6): 3-way tie for 1st\\n     Dennis Martinez is on a roll, and he continued it versus John Tudor Friday.\\nThe Expos have a wide variety of hitters, and - while they aren\\'t among the\\nall-time greats, they are getting the job done.  After winning their first\\nfirst two games, they suddenly found themselves only 2 1/2 games out of\\nfirst in this wacky season.\\n     Martinez triumphed 5-3 on Friday, and WIlliams outdueled Dizzy Dean 3-2\\nSaturday.  However, the Cardinals refused to give up, winning 6-2 on Sunday.\\nThe Cards captured Monday\\'s game, too, as Steve Carlton outdueled Steve\\nRogers 3-2.  \"We\\'re really good against ground ball pitchers because of our\\nteam speed,\" remarked Lou Brock.  \"I don\\'t see why we can\\'t win this\\ndivision.\"\\n     The Phillies and Cubs may have some reasons for them.  Two-thirds of\\nthe way through the season, there is a 3-way tie for first.\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\\n     New York at Pittsburgh(August 3-6): 3 straight 3-2 wins for Bucs,\\nnow 2 back - but in 4th!\\n    \"When your team is in a slump like we are, the worst thing is to play in a\\npitcher\\'s park like this,\" spoke Gil Hodges before the series.  Keith\\nHernandez added that \"their defense takes away quite a few runs per year,\\nand it must be giving them an extra 6-7 wins.\"  The Pirates have made only\\n26 errors all season, 6 ahead of the second place Dodgers.  Error totals tend\\nto be around 50 for the best defensive All-Time teams.\\n     Rube Foster defeated Sid Fernandez 5-2 Friday, and Candelaria outshone\\nSeaver 3-2 Saturday, in a game featuring some outstanding defense.  When\\nNolan Ryan and two relivers 6-hit the Mets in another 3-2 win Sunday, the\\nPirates could once again look forward to a victory getting them back to the\\n.500 mark.  They had been unable to several times in the past month.  Bert\\nBlyleven met Dwight Gooden in the afternoon game.  Both pitchers possessed\\nfantastic stuff, and the only runs scored through eight innings were on home\\nruns - a solo shot by Rusty Staub of the Mets and a two-run blast by Ralph\\nKiner for the Pirates.  The Mets\\' Darryl Strawberry singled home a run in the\\ntop of the ninth off Jesse Orosco, working his second inning, after Mookie\\nWilson pinch-ran for Gary Carter at second.  With one out and a runner on\\nfirst, Lee Mazilli was sent in to pinch-hit.  The Pirates countered with Kent\\nTekulve, placing him in the fifth spot in the order and putting Barry Bonds in\\nleft field as the ninth place hitter.  Tekulve induced a groundout forcing\\nStrawberry at second.  He slid hard into Honus Wagner, preventing the\\nPirates from turning their fifth double play of the afternoon.  Tekulve\\nallowed a hit, but Clemente threw Mazilli out at third from near the right\\nfield line, ending the inning.  Tug McGraw relieved Randy Myers, who entered\\nto pitch the eighth, and got one out before Bonds launched a rocket to deep\\ncenter, running through the stop sign at third to score an inside-the-park\\nhomer to win.  The Pirates had scored an improbable 3 straight 3-2 wins,\\nand had moved to within 2 games of first place, with seven weeks to go.\\n------------------------------------------------------------------\\n     San Francisco at Boswaukta(August 3-5): \\n    Another Sunday doubleheader appeared on the schedule, as the Giants\\nmanaged to close the gap on the other teams thanks to some starting\\npitching that just wouldn\\'t tire.  In fact, reported manager John McGraw,\\n\"once this rough part of the schedule is over, maybe as early as this coming\\nweek, we may shift to a 4-man rotation again for a little while.\"\\n     Juan Marichal continued his hot pitching Friday, beating Lew Burdette and\\nthe Braves 4-1.  Willie Mays had all four r.b.i.s on 3 hits.  Rick Reuschel\\nfaced Joe Niekro Saturday in a slugfest.  The Braves\\' park had been a homer\\nhaven, but this took the cake, as the Giants won a seesaw affair 16-13.\\nWillie Mays had three homers, Willie McCovey, Eddie Matthews, and Don\\nBaylor had two, and Hank Aaron, Ernie Lombardi, Biz Mackey, and Mel Ott had\\none each.  The Braves had collected 149 home runs going into Sunday\\'s\\ndoubleheader, putting them on a pace for 223, which would be 4 short of the\\nNational League record.  They were still a tad behind the \\'61 Yankees\\' pace.\\nThey had allowed over 120, though.  Vida Blue actually got the win after\\nretiring 2 batters in the fifth.  He allowed only a run in the sixth, but\\nfaltered in the seventh.  Joe McGinnity earned the save.\\n     In the doubleheader, the Braves\\' Hoyt Wilhelm failed to hold a lead in the\\nfirst game, but Hank Aaron homered off Bill Foster in the eighth as the\\nBraves won, 4-3.  The Giants took the second game, however, by a 6-2 score.\\nThe homer by Aaron was a magical #150 by the Braves; however, they fell to\\nthree game below .500, making a comeback extremely unlikely.\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\\n     San Diego at Cincinnati(Aug. 3-5):  Randy Jones faced Ewell\\nBlackwell in the first of this 3-game series, and the Padres felt rather\\ngood.  With Don Mattingly straining his back in the last Cleveland game, the\\ntrade looked even better.  McGriff\\'s batting average was even rising.  Of\\ncourse, the bench was very poor, and Joe Gordon was only adequate in the\\noutfield, but these were minor problems, since the pitching was holding up.\\n     Jones pitched a good game Friday, and won 6-3.  McGriff launched two\\nhome runs.  Mel Harder earned a win with the help of Mark Davis and Ray\\nNarleski Saturday; 5-4 was the final score.  Tom Candiotti battled Satchel\\nPaige to a 3-3 tie through eight innings before departing.  The game was\\nscoreless for 4 more innings until the thirteenth.  Paige had departed after\\n10, and John Franco hurled a scoreless inning.  Tom Browning was working\\nhis second scoreless inning, when Dave Winfield doubled with one out and\\nJoe Gordon was pitched around.  Thurm Munson doubled both runners home,\\nand the Padres gamed a 5-3 win.  The three-game sweep had pulled the\\nGiants into a tie with the Reds.  Though the Reds denied it, the highly\\nemotional series with the Dodgers may have taken too much out of them.\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\\n     Brookangeles at Houston(August 3-5):\\n     Another series capped off by a weekend doubleheader took place in the\\nwide open plains of the Astrodome.  The Astros sent Joe Niekro to the hill in\\nthe first game, opposite Don Drysdale.  \"Normally,\" Drysdale remarked, \"I\\nwould be challenging hitter by being ready to throw at them.  I can\\'t afford\\nto with this team, though; we have to get our own runners going; we can\\'t\\nDavis will get decked once.\"\\n     The fact that Glenn Davis leads the team in homers with six (!) is\\nprimarily why he would be decked, but it should be understood that his\\ncurrent pace would give him nine for the season.  The hitting on this team is\\na little better, but the power is all doubles and triples.  Still, Carl Furillo is\\nthe main reason no Astro home runs were hit over the weekend, as he threw\\ntwo runners out trying for inside-the-park homers.  For those unaware of\\nthe nastness of the Astros\\' park, they have a 23-foot high gray wall all\\naround the outfield; balls must be hit into the seats to be home runs.  The\\nfoul poles are 355 feet from home plate, but the alleys are 400 feet away,\\nwith center field at 420 feet.  \"It\\'s as if some three-year-old threw a\\ntantrum and told his playmates: \\'If I can\\'t hit home runs, nobody will hit\\nhome runs\\',\" remarked Roy Campanella.\\n     The Dodgers stole five bases Friday, but the Astros decided to revitalize\\nthe Baltimore chopping that had failed 6 weeks before; for tonight, anyway,\\nDavis, Jim Wynn, and Jose Cruz did not have to mess with their swings,\\naccording to the manager.  After Poles and Willie Wells reached base via the\\nBaltimore chop, Drysdale decked Jose Cruz with a pitch.  He responded with\\na two-run double, but Wynn - playing first for Davis - popped up, and the\\nAstros didn\\'t score any more in that inning.  They did score 3 in the fourth to\\nerase a 3-2 deficit, and the Astros wound up winning 6-4.  They threatened\\nto do even better the next game, as Tommy John would be their opponent.\\nWalt Alston met privately with the starters at 6 A.M. before the game.\\n     \"I think I know how we can beat the Baltimore Chop,\" he explained.\\n     \"How can we do that,\" Pee Wee Reese wondered.\\n     \"They\\'re going to be beating the ball down, so we\\'ve got to be ready to\\nthrow on the run.  Steve will start at first to dig balls out of the dirt, but I\\nwant all of you to practice your barehanded picks and throws.  We\\'ll go with\\na shallow infield almost the whole time.\"\\n     The plan almost worked.  Mike Scott allowed only two runs through eight\\ninnings, but the Astros got three; two of them scored when Bill Doran\\npushed a bunt into the outfield in the fourth with runners on second and\\nthird.  3-2 Astros was the final, with Dave Smith earning another save.  The\\nDodgers scored a victory in the first game of the twin bill Sunday, as Nolan\\nRyan walked five, three of whom scored in a 4-1 Dodger win.  Fernando\\nValenzuela lost the second game 4-2 to Don Sutton, however, as the Dodgers\\'\\nthirteen stolen bases in the series proved to not be enough.\\n     \"We\\'re mostly a power team,\" remarked Ron Cey.  \"Jackie and, when he\\nplays, Maury Wills are our only real speed demons, though a couple other\\nplays can do it now and then.  We\\'re sunk in a place like the Astrodome.  I\\nguess that\\'s why they\\'re so successful there.\"  Indeed, it seems that\\nbasestealing teams give them the most trouble in the dome.  The \\'Stros\\nswiped 12 bases in 16 attempts, giving them 230 on the season.\\n     Standings after these weekend series:\\nA.L.East\\nTeam                     W           L           GB\\nNew York                68        42          --\\nCleveland               65        46          3.5\\nDetroit                 64        46           4\\nBoston                  64        47          4.5\\nBaltimore               59        52         9.5\\nToronto                 43         69        25.5\\nWashington              39         73          28\\n\\nA.L.West\\nOaksaselphia            63         48          --\\nMinnesota               61         48            1\\nChicago                 59         53          4.5\\nKansas City             57         54          6.5\\nCalifornia              57         56            8\\nMilwaukee               45         66           17\\nSeattle                 32         78         31.5\\n\\nN.L.East\\nChicago          57         53                --\\nPhiladelphia     58         54                --\\nSt. Louis        58         54                --\\nPittsburgh       56         56                2\\nMontreal         53         56               3.5\\nNew York         48         64               10\\n\\nN.L.West\\nBrookangeles     66          46               --\\nCincinnati       66           47              0.5\\nSan Francisco    65          46               0.5\\nBoswaukta        54           56               11\\nHouston          50          61               17.5\\nSan Diego        36          75                29.5',\n  \"\\n\\nIs it a hidden option?

From a business\\nstandpoint, it may make sense to keep Lopez down until June/the\\nfirst time Olson/Berryhill go on the DL.\\n\\n4)  I am still disappointed that Lopez isn\\'t on the team.\\nI still prefer to think of myself as a fan when it comes to the Braves,\\nand the truth is that I\\'d rather see our best team on the field,\\nwhich, IMO, includes Lopez.\\n\\nOf course,today we play the Cubs.  Hopefully, we won\\'t need him. ;)\\n\\nAs for the Schuerholz/Cox conversation, I imagine it went\\nlike this:  (Remember, they\\'ve BOTH been GM\\'s)\\n(the following is not meant to be read by the humor-impaired)\\n\\nCox:  OK, we\\'ve sent Jones down.  His fielding could be a\\nlittle smoother.  Besides, Blauser can hit OK and his fielding\\nis better than it used to be.\\n\\nSchuerholz:  Well, we\\'ll have to send Nieves down too.  Deion\\njust won\\'t sign that baseball only contract.  We can\\'t count\\non him in October, so we have to keep Nixon around for the\\ndefense.  Besides, Gorman\\'s not ready to give up on\\nBilly Hatcher yet.  Once Hatcher\\'s gone AND Deion signs,\\nwe can move Nixon for Frankie Rodriguez.  That ought to\\ngive us some pitching depth in 1995.\\n\\nCox:  Yep, that\\'ll be nice.  Too bad Deion won\\'t sign.\\nOK, I\\'ll look for Nieves when Justice starts having\\nBerry-Berry...er, back problems again.  Now, what about\\nKlesko?\\n\\nSchuerholz:  Well, we\\'ve still got to fork out another 1.5 mil\\nfor Bream.  If we keep Klesko, we either lose the money\\nor Cabrera.  I keep dangling Sid in front of Dal Maxwell,\\nbut somehow he doesn\\'t seem to be the same GM.  First\\nJeffries for Jose, and now Whiten for Clark!  If he\\ngets rid of Brian Jordan, then I\\'d HAVE to believe that he\\nand Whitey Herzog switched bodies at the Winter Meetings!\\n\\nCox:  OK, keep trying on Bream, and I\\'ll wait til the trading\\ndeadline for my Hunter/Klesko platoon.  Maybe I can get a few\\nextra at-bats for Cabrera while we wait.  Try California...\\nif Snow starts slowly, maybe WhiteyDal will bite on Sid.\\nAnd if that doesn\\'t work, then perhaps Sid\\'s knees\\ncould be \"persuaded\" to act up.  There\\'s always the\\n15-day DL!  Mwa-ha-ha-ha-ha!\\n\\nSchuerholz:  What about Caraballo?\\n\\nCox:  Well, he\\'s not that much better than Lemke.  Maybe if he starts\\nin Richmond, he\\'ll start walking more.  Besides, if he\\'s going to be\\narbitration-eligible, better to stretch him out so that we actually\\nget some value from him before he makes the big bucks.\\n\\nSchuerholz:  Now, let\\'s see.  That leaves Lopez.\\n\\nCox:  NOOOOO!  I gotta keep Lopez!  Sure, I didn\\'t think Olson\\nwould recover this quickly.  Maybe I can talk Caminiti into\\nrunning into him again?\\n\\nSchuerholz:  Nope, Lopez has gotta go.  You know that he\\'ll get\\n$3 million in arbitration.  May as well put it off that one\\nextra year.  Besides, until Olson\\'s shown his stuff a little\\nbit, I can\\'t trade him.  Besides, Berryhill\\'s a left-handed\\nhitter.  You know how rare that is?\\n\\nCox:  Don\\'t you mean a left-handed whiffer?  Pretty common,\\nif you ask me.  I mean, he made Pat Borders look good in\\nthe World Series.  PAT BORDERS!!!\\n\\nSchuerholz:  Hey, you\\'re the one who wouldn\\'t write Lopez\\ninto the lineup.\\n\\nCox:  Well, you\\'re the one who went out and got me Jeff\\nReardon!  Besides, I thought Lopez wouldn\\'t be used\\nto our pitching staff\\'s stuff.  He got some time with\\nthem this spring...looked pretty good.  Come on, surely\\nwe only need to keep one stiff behind the plate?\\n\\nSchuerholz:  Yeah, but which stiff?  Whichever one we keep\\nwill be hurt by May.\\n\\nCox:  OK, OK, you made your point.  Keep them both.  Surely\\none of them will be on the DL by June at the latest.  Then I\\ncan call up Lopez, and then we can win 110 games!  The Pennant!\\nTHE WORLD SERIES!  I\\'ll be up there with John McGraw!  Casey\\nStengel!  Earl Weaver!  Oh, they laughed at me in Toronto,\\nbut have you ever had to deal with George Bell?  I\\'ll finally\\nget my just reward!  Mwa-ha-ha-ha!\\n\\nSchuerholz:  Easy, Bobby.  Have you been taking those\\n\"happy pills\" left around by Chuck Tanner?

But this year, officials are retreating - drug use by\\n    eighth-graders has risen, according to the survey of 50,000 students\\n    nationwide.\\n\\n    Possible reason for the increase:  more experimentation.  Why?  If\\n    drug use dropped during the \\'80s, eventually some students will\\n    have fewer \"drug-using contemporaries\" who act as examples of\\n    substance abuse\\'s drawbacks, says social psychologist Lloyd Johnston,\\n    one of the survey authors.  Each new wave of youths \"must be given\\n    the knowledge, skills and motivation to resist using these drugs,\"\\n    Johnston says.\\n\\n    This type of resurgence \"is possible,\" says Eileen Shiff, author of\\n    \"Experts Advise Parents\" (Delta, $14.95).  But that\\'s not the issue,\\n    she says.  The prevalence of alcohol and drugs among teens today\\n    could result in more alcoholic adults decades from now.\\n\\n    Aggravating the problem:  baby boomer parents - who experimented with\\n    drugs and alcohol as teens - trying to be friends, not parents, to\\n    their children.  \"I\\'ve even seen parents serving kegs of beer\" to\\n    their underage kids and friends, Shiff says.  For a recent graduation,\\n    Shiff and other parents organized an all-night, \"lock-in\" party where\\n    no booze or drugs were allowed.  \"We need to fulfill that parental\\n    role, otherwise the peer group takes over,\" she says.\\n\\n    Officials may \"talk about the war on drugs, but they really haven\\'t\\n    done anything that I\\'ve seen,\" says Suzanne Linkous, Scottsdale,\\n    Ariz., 16, a volunteer who talks with teens about drugs, dating and\\n    other issues on a peer counseling and suicide hot line.  Linkous, a\\n    member of USA Today\\'s Teen Panel, says \"there\\'s always going to be\\n    experimentation\" with drugs.\\n\\n    A real war on drugs could be waged \"education-wise,\" she says.  But\\n    \"some don\\'t want to give kids the facts.  They think it will give\\n    them ideas; it\\'s the same with birth control.  I think you should\\n    give the kids the information or have it accessible\" through classes,\\n    pamphlets and speakers, she says.\\n\\n    Education efforts need to start as soon as kids get in school - in\\n    kindergarten, says Dallas Owens, 17, teen panelist from Miami Shores,\\n    Fla.  \"I remember in kindergarten, I used to see (drugs).

There is only one way of determin-\\ning \"best\" in baseball.  And that is by looking at the  scoreboard  at\\nthe  end  of  the game.  Each game determines which *team* is the best\\nthat day.  At the end of the season, the team that was  the  best  the\\nmost  often  is  the best in the division.  The playoffs determine the\\nbest of the best.  But the point is that the only decision making pro-\\ncess  used to determine the \"best\" is the score of the game and it re-\\nlates to the *teams*.  Not the individual players.  There is no method\\ninherent  in  baseball of comparing individual performances.  And that\\nis how it should be, because, after all, baseball is a team game.\\n\\nTo say that one player is better than another is to be able to say ab-\\nsolutely  that  player A\\'s team would have played better with player B\\nin their lineup.  Sheer speculation.  Impossible to ascertain.\\n\\nIf you want to select a group of statistics and claim that Clemens has\\ndone  better  with those statistics as a criteria, then fine.

So  until you can prove that Clemens contributes to a WS cham-\\npionship more than Morris your evaluation of  Clemens is totally  sub-\\njective  and  is  mere opinion.  I have yet to see that any of you can\\npredict a WS winner with any greater accuracy than Jeanne Dixon.\\n\\n\\nExactly.  The Jays won with Morris pitching.

For inputs the problem essentially\\nstarts with two sets of points where each set of points is on the \\nedge of an object which we treat as two dimensional, i.e. only extant\\nbetween the edges, but which exists in three dimensional space.  To draw \\nthe object we \\n\\n1) fit a cubic spline through the points.  Each spline is effectively\\n\\tcomputed as a sequence of line segments approximating the\\n        curve.  Each spline has an equal number of segments.  We assume\\n\\tthat the nth segment along each spline is roughly, but not\\n\\texactly, the same distance along each spline by any reasonable\\n\\tmeasure.\\n2) Take each segment (n) along each spline and match it to the nth segment\\n\\tof the opposing spline.  Use the pair of segments to form two\\n\\ttriangles which will be filled in to color the surface.\\n3) Depth sort the triangles\\n4) Take each triangle in sorted order, project onto a 2D pixmap, draw\\n\\tand color the triangle.  Take the edge of the triangle that is\\n\\talong the edge of the surface and draw a line along that edge\\n\\tcolored with a special \"edge color\"\\n\\n\\tIt is the edge coloring in step 4 that is at the heart of the\\nproblem.  The idea is to effectively outline the edge of the surface.\\nThe net result however generally has lots of breaks and gaps in\\nthe edge of the surface.

I have a IIsi that came\\nwith a Quantum 80 meg drive. When I ran into space problems, I slapped in\\nanother 40 meg quantum that I had sitting on a shelf. Here is what I did.\\n \\nFirst off, I was concerned about space. Since both drives are Quantum\\nquarter height drives, I finally decided that the logical place for them\\nwas stacked one upon the other. Fine, they fit snugly. (I have not had a\\nproblem with heat yet, and these drives have been running together for\\nover two months.\\n\\nThe next problem was connecting the drive. If you have a spare internal\\nhard disk power cable as I did, then half of your troubles are over. just\\nsplice in the extra cable so that you get one square motherboard\\nconnector and two hard disk power connectors. If you don't have a spare\\ncable, you will have to buy the wires and connectors which can be found\\nin any good electronics store for about $10. I would suggest properly\\nsoldering/heatshrinking the connections to reduce the possibility of\\nshorts or bad connections.\\n\\nNext, you need a ribbon cable connection. Again, I had a spare hard disk\\nribbon cable, and I wanted to be careful in case this didn't word so what\\nI did was purchase a crimp on 50 pin cable connector that gave me another\\nmale connector in the middle of my spare cable. The part cost $10 again,\\nand is easily attached with any good wood vice. The theory behind using a\\ncrimp on connector is that if this doesn't work, my original cable is not\\ndamaged, and I can go back to the original setup.\\n\\nHaving done all that, I couldn't be bothered to check the dev notes for\\npower consumption so I plugged it in and it works like a charm to this\\nday. \\n\\nIn a mac II, everything should work the same. Be careful with the ID's of\\nthe drive, and ensure that the terminating resistors on both drives are\\nintact.

For\\n   example:\\n\\n    a) For (x,y) points for which you know the Reference(x,y), you\\n       can move alpha0*(Reference(x,y) - Current(x,y)).   This will\\n       slowly move the DistortedReference(x,y) towards the\\n       Reference(x,y). \\n    b) For all other points, examine the current length of each edge.\\n       For each edge, compute a displacement which would make that edge\\n       the correct length (where \"correct\" is the DigitizedLength). \\n       Take the vector sum of these edge displacements, and move the\\n       point alpha1*SumOfEdgeDisplacements.  This will keep the\\n       triangulated mesh consistent with your Digitized mesh.\\n\\n3) Iterate 2) until you are happy (for example, no point moves very much).\\n\\nalpha0 and alpha1 need to be determined by experimentation.   Consider\\nhow much you believe the Reference(x,y) - i.e., do you absolutely insist\\non the final points exactly matching the References, or do you want to\\nbalance some error in matching the Reference against changes in length\\nof the edges.\\n\\nWARNING: there are a couple of geometric invariants which must be\\nobserved (essentially, you can\\'t allow the convex hull to change, and\\nyou can\\'t allow triangles to \"fold over\" neighboring triangles.  Both of\\nthese can be handled either by special case checks on the motion of\\nindividual points, or by periodically re-triangulating the points (using \\nthe current positions - but still calculating DigitizedLength from the\\noriginal positions.

Security Council Resolution 713 of \\n  September 25, 1991, the United Nations has been actively \\n  addressing the crisis in the former Yugoslavia.  The Security \\n  Council acted in Resolution 781 to establish a ban on all \\n  unauthorized military flights over Bosnia-Herzegovina.  There \\n  have, however, been blatant violations of the ban, and villages \\n  in Bosnia have been bombed.\\n  \\n  In response to these violations, the Security Council decided, \\n  in Resolution 816 of March 31, 1993, to extend the ban to all \\n  unauthorized flights over Bosnia-Herzegovina and to authorize \\n  Member States, acting nationally or through regional organi-\\n  zations, to take all necessary measures to ensure compliance.  \\n  NATO's North Atlantic Council (NAC) agreed to provide NATO air \\n  enforcement for the no-fly zone.  The U.N. Secretary General \\n  was notified of NATO's decision to proceed with Operation DENY \\n  FLIGHT, and an activation order was delivered to participating \\n  allies.\\n  \\n  The United States actively supported these decisions.  At my \\n  direction, the Joint Chiefs of Staff sent an execute order to \\n  all U.S. forces participating in the NATO force, for the conduct \\n  of phased air operations to prevent flights not authorized by \\n  the United Nations over Bosnia-Herzegovina.  The U.S. forces \\n  initially assigned to this operation consist of 13 F-15 and \\n  12 F-18A fighter aircraft and supporting tanker aircraft.  \\n  These aircraft commenced enforcement operations at 8:00 a.m. \\n  e.d.t. on April 12, 1993.  The fighter aircraft are equipped for \\n  combat to accomplish their mission and for self-defense.\\n  \\n  NATO has positioned forces and has established combat air \\n  patrol (CAP) stations within the control of Airborne Early \\n  Warning (AEW) aircraft.  The U.S. CAP aircraft will normally \\n  operate from bases in Italy and from an aircraft carrier in the \\n  Adriatic Sea.  Unauthorized aircraft entering or approaching \\n  the no-fly zone will be identified, interrogated, intercepted, \\n  escorted/monitored, and turned away (in that order).  If these \\n  steps do not result in compliance with the no-fly zone, such \\n  aircraft may be engaged on the basis of proper authorization by \\n  NATO military authorities and in accordance with the approved \\n  \\n                                more\\n  \\n       \\t    \\t      \\t   \\t     \\t       \\t    (OVER)\\n\\x0c\\n                                  2\\n  \\n  rules of engagement, although we do not expect such action will \\n  be necessary.  The Commander of UNPROFOR (the United Nations \\n  Protection Force currently operating in Bosnia-Herzegovina) was \\n  consulted to ensure that his concerns for his force were fully \\n  considered before the rules of engagement were approved.\\n  \\n  It is not possible to predict at this time how long such \\n  operations will be necessary.  I have directed U.S. armed forces \\n  to participate in these operations pursuant to my constitutional \\n  authority as Commander in Chief.  I am grateful for the con-\\n  tinuing support that the Congress has given to this effort, and \\n  I look forward to continued cooperation as we move forward \\n  toward attainment of our goals in this region.\\n  \\n       \\t    \\t      \\t   \\tSincerely,\\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n       \\t    \\t      \\t   \\tWILLIAM J.

Basically it changes things\\n   when told to by the server and then renders an image from the user's\\n   viewpoint. It also provides the server with information about the user's\\n   actions - which can then be communicated to other clients and therefore to\\n   other users.\\n\\n   The client is designed to be generic - in other words you don't need to\\n   develop a new client when you want to enter a new world. This means that\\n   resources can be spent on enhancing the client software rather than adapting\\n   it. The adaptations, as will be explained in a moment, occur in the servers.\\n\\n   This release of the client software supports the following functionality:\\n\\n    o Hierarchical Objects (with associated addressing)\\n\\n    o Multiple Light Sources and Types (Ambient, Point and Spot)\\n\\n    o User Interface Panels\\n\\n    o Colour Polygonal Rendering with Phong Shading (optional wireframe for\\n\\tfaster frame rates)\\n\\n    o Mouse and Keyboard Input\\n\\n   (Some people may be disappointed that this software doesn't support the\\n   PowerGlove as an input device - this is not because it can't, but because\\n   I don't have one! This will, however, be one of the first enhancements!)\\n\\n  Server(s):\\n   This is where customization can take place. The following basic support is\\n   provided in this release for potential world server developers:\\n\\n    o Transparent Client Management\\n\\n    o Client Message Handling\\n\\n   This may not sound like much, but it takes away the headache of\\naccepting and\\n   terminating clients and receiving messages from them - the\\napplication writer\\n   can work with the assumption that things are happening locally.\\n\\n   Things get more interesting in the object extension functionality. This is\\n   what is provided to allow you to animate your objects:\\n\\n    o Server Selectable Extension Installation:\\n        What this means is that you can decide which objects have extended\\n        functionality in your world. Basically you call the extension\\n        initialisers you want.\\n\\n    o Event Handler Registration:\\n        When you develop extensions for an object you basically write callback\\n        functions for the events that you want the object to respond to.\\n        (Current events supported: INIT, MOVE, CHANGE, COLLIDE & TERMINATE)\\n\\n    o Collision Detection Registration:\\n        If you want your object to respond to collision events just provide\\n        some basic information to the collision detection management software.\\n        Your callback will be activated when a collision occurs.\\n\\n    This software is kept separate from the worldServer applications because\\n    the application developer wants to build a library of extended objects\\n    from which to choose.\\n\\n    The following is all you need to make a World Server application:\\n\\n    o Provide an initWorld function:\\n        This is where you choose what object extensions will be supported, plus\\n        any initialization you want to do.\\n\\n    o Provide a positionObject function:\\n        This is where you determine where to place a new client.\\n\\n    o Provide an installWorldObjects function:\\n        This is where you load the world (.wld) file for a new client.\\n\\n    o Provide a getWorldType function:\\n        This is where you tell a new client what persona they should have.\\n\\n    o Provide an animateWorld function:\\n        This is where you can go wild! At a minimum you should let the objects\\n        move (by calling a move function) and let the server sleep for a bit\\n        (to avoid outrunning the clients).\\n\\n    That's all there is to it! And to prove it here are the line counts for the\\n    three world servers I've provided:\\n\\n        generic - 81 lines\\n        dactyl - 270 lines (more complicated collision detection due to the\\n                           stairs!

I\\'d venture to point out, \\nhowever, that if libertarians couldn\\'t convince at least 85% of a group \\nof \"seminar participants\" to \"embrace\" their philosophy, their \\npropaganda skills need to be honed.  \\n\\nFrankly, however, it is no great trick to create a government for a \\nsociety in which (almost) everyone is assumed to agree about what is a proper\\ngovernment policy.  Once that is assumed, all sorts of annoying formalities\\ncan be dispensed with, elections, police, etc.  And as Mr. Marx said,\\nthe state will just wither away.  \\n\\nOn the way there, however, would you like to explain how eliminating \\nvirtually all policies that restrain private coercion in the \\ncurrent society will help us to live happier lives? Or is it like\\nsocialism; just some short-term pain that we\\'ll have to bear until \\neveryone has had the benefit of \"re-education\" through regular \\n\"seminar\" training?\\n\\njsh\\n',\n  'Having run completely out of time, I\\'ve got to get my prophesies and\\npredictions for the A.L. out.

Valenzuela (the original 30-something) may be\\n  the fifth starter.  Oates puts his best hitters at the bottom of the lineup.\\n  (Does anybody else think that might be a calculated maneuver to minimize\\n  the effect of a slumping Ripken?

EDT\\n\\n\\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Good afternoon.  Ladies and gentlemen, \\ntwo months ago I presented a comprehensive plan to reduce our \\nnational deficit and to increase our investment in the American \\npeople, their jobs and their economic future.  The federal budget \\nplan passed Congress in record time, and created a new sense of hope \\nand opportunity in the country.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Then, the short-term jobs plan I presented to Congress, \\nwhich would create a half a million jobs in the next two years passed \\nthe House of Representatives two weeks ago.  It now has the support \\nof a majority of the United States Senate. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     All of these members of Congress know it's time to get \\nthe economy moving again, to get job growth going again, to get a \\nfast start on the investments we need to build a lasting prosperity.  \\nUnfortunately, a minority of the members of the United States Senate \\nhave used gridlock tactics to prevent their colleagues from working \\nthe will of the majority on the jobs bill.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     When Congress returns, I ask every senator from every \\nstate and from both parties to remember what is at stake.  The issue \\nis not politics, it's people.  Sixteen million of them are looking \\nfor full-time jobs and can't find them.  These men and women don't \\ncare about who's up or down in Washington.  They care about paying \\nthe rent and meeting the mortgage payment, about putting food on the \\ntable and buying shoes for their children, about regaining a sense of \\ndignity that comes from doing a day's work and supporting their \\nfamilies and drawing a paycheck.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     They're asking those of us who have the privilege of \\nserving to put aside politics and do something now to move our \\neconomy forward.  I am prepared to do that.  And I have been working \\nwith the Senate to come up with an adjusted package that meets some \\nof the concerns of those who have been blocking action on the jobs \\nplan.  I'm willing to compromise, so long as we keep the focus on \\njobs, keep the focus on growth and keep the focus on meeting unmet \\nnational needs.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Our opponents have been asking for a smaller package.  \\nToday I ask them to join me in determining exactly what kind and what \\nsize package Congress can approve that actually meets the needs of \\nthe American people. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     But even as we make those reductions and the package \\nwill be smaller, I believe we must address problems that are on the \\nminds of millions of Americans, and one in particular, and that is \\nthe need to toughen law enforcement in our society to deal with the \\ndramatic rise in violent crime. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     So I will ask, even in this reduced package, for an \\nadditional $200 million in federal funding to help local communities \\nto rehire police officers who have been laid off because of the \\nfiscal problems caused by the national recession.  Together, with a \\nmatching effort by local governments, this could put as many as \\n10,000 police officers back on the job, and back on the beat in \\ncommunities all across our nation.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     At a time when too many of our people live in fear of \\nviolent crime, when too many businesses have closed and too many \\npeople have lost their jobs because people are afraid to leave their \\nhomes, rehiring thousands of officers is one of the best investments \\nAmerica can make.  And I ask both Houses of Congress to make that \\ninvestment in our people's safety and in their piece of mind.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I believe in the need for strong federal action to keep \\nthe economy going toward recovery and to create jobs.  Make no \\nmistake about it:  I will fight for these priorities as hard as I \\never have.  I will never forget that the people sent me here to fight \\nfor their jobs, their future and for fundamental change.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I want to thank the police officers who are here today \\nand tell you that not a single one of them knew before they came here \\nthat I had determined to ask for more money in this jobs bill to \\nrehire police officers.  They came here because they believe in the \\nsummer jobs portion of the package.  And I want them to be free to \\ntalk about that.  They came here not out of any law enforcement \\nconcern other than the fact that they wanted the kids in this country \\nto have a chance to have jobs this summer, to have safer streets and \\na brighter and more peaceful future.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I say what I say today not just because it's good for \\nlaw enforcement but because it's good for the people who live in \\nthese communities.  I have always supported community policing not \\nonly because it helps to prevent crime and to lower the crime rate, \\nbut because it cements better relationships between people in law \\nenforcement and the people that they're hired to protect.  It reduces \\nthe chances of abusive action by police officers and increases the \\nchances of harmony and safe streets at the same time.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     These are the kinds of things that we are trying to do.  \\nI promised in my campaign that I'd do everything I could to put \\nanother 100,000 police officers on the street over the next four \\nyears.  This makes a good downpayment on that.  This keeps in mind \\nthe core of the jobs package.  And this will help us to move forward.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     So I ask the people in the Senate who have blocked the \\njobs bill, let's work together.  I can accept a reduced package if \\nyou will increase your commitment to safe streets.  I do not accept \\nthe fact that we should reduce our commitment to summer jobs or to \\nbuilding our infrastructure or to doing those other things that will \\ncreate real and lasting  prosperity for our people.  I have done my \\npart now to end the gridlock; I ask you to do yours.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I want now to give the people who are here with me on \\nthe platform a chance to make some remarks and to be heard by the \\nAmerican people -- beginning with Janet Reno, the distinguished \\nAttorney General.\\n  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   * \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President, can you tell us -- do you think that \\nthe jobs package could be put in further jeopardy by controversy over \\nthe suggestion of a VAT tax at this point in the congressional \\ndialogue?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Not at all.  I think it should have --\\nthey wouldn't have any relationship one to the other.  First of all, \\nI made absolutely no decision on that.  You should know that there's \\na lot of support in the business community and the labor community -- \\npeople have asked us to consider that because of the enormous burden \\nof the present system on many of our major employers, particularly \\nmany of those that we depend upon to generate jobs and to carry the \\nstrength of this economy.  But I have made absolutely no decision \\nthat would even approach that on that or any other kind of general \\ntax.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Do you personally believe that the American public \\nis ready to pay for -- to have another tax to pay for health care?  I \\nmean, apart from what business and labor leaders have said --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I'm not going to speculate on that.  I \\nwill say this:  The real issue is how quickly we can recycle the \\nbenefits of all the savings to cover the cost.  I mean, that is --\\neveryone knows that if you do what we're proposing to do, if you \\nstreamline the insurance system, if you fix the system so that \\nthere's no longer an enormous economic incentive to over-utilize or \\nover-provide certain services, if you provide primary and preventive \\ncare in places where it isn't now, every single analysis shows \\nabsolutely massive savings to the health care system.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     The real question is whether you can transfer those \\nsavings to cover those who have no coverage now or those who have \\nvirtually no coverage so that you provide people the security.  I \\nhave no idea.  The polls say that, but I don't know.  All I know is \\nthe polls that I see in the press that many of you have commissioned, \\nthey say overwhelmingly the American people want the security of an \\naffordable health care system.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     But I don't think that has anything to do with this \\nstimulus, and it certainly shouldn't have.  People want a job first \\nand foremost.  They want that more than anything else.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Now that you've announced your willingness to \\ncompromise on the stimulus package, can you tell us what parts of \\nyour package you consider vital and uncompromisable?  I assume summer \\njobs is one.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I want the summer jobs; I want the \\nhighway program and I want the police program.  I still intend -- let \\nme say this:  I still intend to fully and aggressively push the crime \\nbill, which did not pass the Congress last year.  This is a \\nsupplement to that, not a substitute for it in any way.  But I think \\nwe need to do that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I think we need the Ryan White funds because of the \\nenormous health care burdens to the communities that are inordinately \\nand disproportionately affected by the problems of caring for people \\nwith AIDS.  And there are several other things that I think should be \\ndone.  We have to do the Agriculture Department meat inspectors; the \\nsafety of the public depends on that.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     There are a number of other things that I don't -- I \\ndon't think any of it should be cut, but I have given Senator \\nMitchell and Senator Byrd -- I talked to them.  And Senator Dole \\ncalled me yesterday to discuss this, and I told him that I would call \\nhim back.  I called him back last night in New Hampshire and we \\ndiscussed this.  And I basically asked them to talk today, and said \\nthat I would not make any statements about any specifics until at \\nleast they had a chance to talk to see whether or not they could \\nreach some accord.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     So I don't want to be any more specific than I have been \\nalready, and let's see if they can talk it out.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  When you talked to Senator Dole and Senator \\nMitchell did you tell them about your -- increase also, that $200 \\nmillion, that you want that as part of the package?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I did -- I told Senator -- I left word \\nfor Senator Mitchell last night about it.  When I talked to Senator \\nDole -- I don't remember for sure -- I do not believe I mentioned it.  \\nBut I did tell him that I was prepared to reduce the package and I \\nwanted to break the gridlock, and I told him that I was working on a \\nreformulation of it so that -- in the hope that it would become even \\nmore focused on jobs and the kinds of issues that I thought the \\nAmerican people wanted us to address.  And this is certainly \\nconsistent with that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Thank you.\",\n  '\\nAhhh, the classic Truth By Blatant Assertion technique.  Too bad it\\'s\\nso demonstrably false.

Thus it\\nis tangentially relevant to soc.history and alt.revisionism but I have directed\\nfollowups to t.p.m since it is principally consideration of the political\\nlessons to be drawn from the history of the NAZI party that I deal with.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLet us assume for the sake of argument that this was indeed the case? Does\\nthis mean that Hilter would have been in any way less guilty of mass murder\\nbecause he aquiesced rather than participated as an active and ardent\\nsupporter?\\n\\nOne of the important things to realise about the NAZIs is that the system\\nwas far more evil than any single member. Once created the NAZI party\\nitself was a murder machine that would inevitably commit genocide, there was\\nnoone within it strong enough to prevent it. Remember that Hitler did not\\noriginaly lead the NAZI party nor was he particularly powerful within it\\nuntil his oratory allowed the party to come to power. Had Hitler reneged\\nupon the emotiaonal expectations which he had created within the ranks of \\nhis supporters he would have been replaced as he had himself replaced the\\nold guard who he beleived were unable to grasp the intellectual implications\\nof their rhetoric. \\n\\nThis is why all parties that espouse NAZI style race supremacy ideologies must\\nbe considered as dangerous and as evil as the NAZIs. The idea that one \"race\"\\nof people is inherently superior to another and that the greatest goal of\\nhumanity is to achieve racial perfection has only one logical outcome,\\nthe gas chambers of Auschwitz.\\n\\nThe NAZI party is not simply the tale of a supremely evil single man who\\nlead an entire country astray, beyond the evil of individuals there was the\\nevil of the system itself which was self generating and self perpetuating.\\nHitler was an extreemly evil person who built his party arround an ego\\ncult centered on the demonstration of his own power, this does not however\\nmean that he was as entirely free from political constraints as he and\\nhis propagandists worked so hard to assert. The myth that racism can\\nproduce a strong government that can cure a nations ills must be \\nemphatically rejected. In the same way we must accept a distinction between\\na govenrment that demonstrates its strength and one that is able to \\ngovern decisively in the manner it beleives is best. I would accept only the\\nlatter as a \"strong\" government since most displays of strength are made\\nnecessary by an essential weakness.\\n\\nIt is important to understand that the NAZIs were not stupid nor were they\\namoral in the sense that they lacked moral scruples. They acted in the\\nsame manner as the Spanish Inquisition - murder and torture in the cause\\nof morality. The fault of the NAZIs lies in their axioms, not in their\\nlogic nor in their implementation of those axioms. Thus all such parties\\nsuch as the National Front or David Dukes Klu Klux Klan front who assert\\nthe truth of those axioms must be considered for what they are, advocates\\nof a system that would commit genocide. \\n\\nThe conclusion that Hitler was not only responsible but imensely evil is\\ninescapable from the historical record. It is important though to not let\\nthe conclusion be reached that the NAZIs espoused a set of ideas that\\nwere basically correct but had an unfortunate proponent. The evils of\\nthe concept of race supremacy are primary. Although this most emphaticaly\\ndoes not excuse individual culpability this is nevertheless secondary.\\n\\nNo matter what the promises made by a racist, supremacist party upon \\nelection those promises will be broken as soon as circumstances permit.\\nIf this requires the replacement of the leaders that originally made\\nthe pledges, that will occur. Hatred is a supreme justifier. It also creates\\na dynamic of its own when those in government allow it reign. For many\\nin government politics is a method of providing a justification for\\ntheir own existence through a demonstration of their importance. A \\nrhetoric of hatred inevitably develops the question of action since the\\ncontinued existence of an object of hatred is inevitably a reminder of the\\nessential impotence of the politician. Thus we have the US raid on Tripoli\\nwhich has little purpose beyond a demonstration of power. It is important\\nto realise that there is no quantum jump between the politics of the right\\nand those of the extreeme right but a progression from the reinforcement\\nof popular predjudice to action being taken on the basis of that predjudice.\\nIn the same way the extreeme left trace their route to despotism through\\ntheir assertion of the subjugation of the individual to ideology.\\n\\nIt is important though that in attempting to understand the dynamics\\nof political systems that this is not used to excuse the participants. The\\nleaders of a nation take on a supreme moral burden but not only do\\nso voluntarily are required to stive to do so. Thus to take on such a \\ntask without a fundamental examination of the logical progression of\\nones set of axioms to its conclusion in itself is a moral crime. Furthermore\\nin taking on such a duty one is obliged to put the interest of the whole\\nbefore personal concerns, even of personal security.\\n\\nAlthough it was inevitable that a party such as the NAZIs, based upon hatred\\nand an idolisation of the symbols of power should have saught to commit\\ngenocide it was not inevitable that they should succeeded. Each member of\\nthe system had an ability to create a change within it that had a possibility\\nof changing the dynamic. Realising that the individual cannot hope to \\ncontrol a system does not mean accepting that the individual cannot \\naffect the system.\\n',\n  '\\n\\nNot to your satisfaction.

In the American south\\n# slave labor was used extensively to grow tobacco, sugar, and rice, all\\n# of which remained labor intensive enterprises well into the 20th century.\\n\\nAnd of course, in states like Kentucky and Virginia, not well-suited to\\nlarge-scale plantations, slave labor was used to make one of the most \\nvaluable agricultural products of all: more slaves.  In some ways, this\\ntreatment of humans beings as breeding livestock is the most horrifying\\naspect of American slavery.\\n\\n# Second, although mechanization of cotton production could be expected to\\n# reduce the demands for labor eventually, it was only in the 1940\\'s \\n# the mechanization of cotton production in the South largely eliminated\\n# the labor intensive character of the operation, long after the \"first\\n# mechanical cotton reaper\" was invented.\\n\\nThis is an interesting question.  Steinbeck\\'s _Grapes of Wrath_\\n(published in the 1930s), uses agricultural mechanization of cotton\\nproduction in Arkansas as the cause of the Joad family being evicted\\nfrom the land.  How many years were involved in the mechanization of\\ncotton farming?

Reproduced under open license granted by Audio\\nBooks, Inc.\\n\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThis is the Dr. Beter AUDIO LETTER(R), 1629 K St. NW, Washington,\\nDC  20006.\\n\\n   Hello, my friends, this is Dr. Beter.  Today is April 30,\\n1982, and this is my AUDIO LETTER(R) No. 74.\\n\\n  It\\'s now been almost one month since war broke out in the South\\nAtlantic.  On the surface it seems that it\\'s only a dispute\\nbetween Argentina and Great Britain over the barren, wind-swept\\nFalkland Islands and South Georgia Island.  In reality, it\\'s far\\nmore than that.\\n\\n   The so-called Falklands crisis is just the visible tip of a\\ngiant military operation.  During this month of April 1982,\\nfierce naval battles have taken place--not only in the South\\nAtlantic but also in the South Pacific.  Up to now most of the\\nhostilities have been kept under wraps by wartime censorship on\\nall sides.  But as I say these words, the naval war in the\\nSouthern Hemisphere is about to come to the surface.\\n\\n   Beginning today, April 30, a total naval and air blockade of\\nthe Falklands by the Royal Navy has begun.  At the same time a\\ncounterblockade has been declared by Argentina in the same area.\\n\\n   To be effective, a blockade must be imposed over a period of\\ntime, but the Royal Navy does not have that much time.  Winter is\\ncoming on in the South Atlantic, and the British supply lines are\\noverextended.  Having come this far, Her Majesty\\'s navy cannot\\nsimply drop the blockade and sail away in a few weeks time\\nwithout drawing blood from Argentina.  As a result the British\\nwill be forced to undertake military operations very soon no\\nmatter how risky they may be.\\n\\n   There is also another reason why the Royal Navy now has no\\nchoice but to engage the Argentine forces in combat.  That\\nreason, my friends, is that the Royal Navy has already suffered\\nlosses in secret combat this month.  Up to this moment there will\\nbe no way to explain away the damage which has been sustained by\\nthe British fleet.  Only when publicly admitted fighting erupts\\nwill the British dare to admit that they have suffered battle\\nlosses.  To obtain that cover story, the British have no choice\\nbut to sail into combat; but in doing so, they will be risking\\neven heavier losses on top of those already sustained.  In short,\\nmy friends, Her Majesty\\'s navy has sailed into a trap.\\n\\n   The events now unfolding in the South Atlantic carry strange,\\nironic echoes of the past.  For weeks now we\\'ve been hearing\\ncountless commentators referring to the British task force as an\\n\"armada\" (quote).  The British of all people ought to be very\\nuneasy with that description.  The original Spanish Armada 400\\nyears ago was renowned as a seemingly invincible fighting force,\\nbut it came to grief in a naval disaster so complete that it\\nchanged the course of history--and it was none other than the\\nEnglish navy that destroyed the Spanish Armada.\\n\\n   The original Spanish Armada put to sea in 1588 during the\\nreign of England\\'s Queen Elizabeth I.  The Armada was an invasion\\nfleet carrying thousands of crack fighting men to invade England. \\nThey were met by the daring sea dogs of Sir Francis Drake.  Drake\\nand his small, fast ships turned the tables on the Spanish Armada\\nby changing the rules of battle.  The English fleet was equipped\\nwith new longer-range guns, and it stayed upwind and out of\\nreach.  From there the English pounded, smashed, and shattered\\nthe big ships of the mighty Armada.  When it was all over, barely\\nhalf the Spanish fleet was left to limp back to port.  Drake\\'s\\ndefeat of the Spanish Armada was a shock to the world.  It opened\\nthe door for England under Queen Elizabeth I to start its\\nexpansion into a truly global empire.\\n\\n   Today, 400 years later, history seems to have come full\\ncircle.  Queen Elizabeth II is witnessing the dismantling of the\\nworld empire whose heyday began under Queen Elizabeth I, and now\\nthe cultures of England and of Spain are once again in\\nconfrontation.  Once again a so-called armada is preparing for\\ninvasion, but this time the armada is British, not Spanish.  Four\\nhundred years ago Sir Francis Drake was the hero of the day;\\ntoday, the ghost of Francis Drake is once again on the scene.\\n\\n   The South Atlantic war zone is at the eastern end of the Drake\\nPassage around the southern tip of South America.  The defeat of\\nthe Spanish Armada four centuries ago broke the back of Spain\\'s\\nnaval supremacy, and now the defeat of the new British armada may\\nwell break the back of what remains of the once glorious Royal\\nNavy.\\n\\n   My three special topics for this AUDIO LETTER are:\\n\\nTopic #1--THE MILITARY SECRET OF SOUTH GEORGIA ISLAND\\nTopic #2--THE SECRET NAVAL WAR OF THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE\\nTopic #3--THE ROCKEFELLER FEAR CAMPAIGN AGAINST NUCLEAR WAR.\\n\\nTopic #1--When the Falkland Islands crisis began early this month\\nit looked at first like a tempest in a teapot.  For a century and\\na half since 1833, the Islands have been controlled by Great\\nBritain.  During that entire time, British sovereignty over the\\nFalklands has been disputed by Argentina.  There have been\\ncountless threats by Argentina to seize the Islands, which it\\ncalls the Malvinas, but the threats have always come to nothing\\nin the past and Britain has never even gotten very worried about\\nthem.\\n\\n   The Islands are four times as distant from Argentina as Cuba\\nis from the United States, and they are not much of a prize. \\nAfter 150 years of occupancy, the Falklands are home to fewer\\nthan 2,000 British settlers and a lot of sheep.  In short, the\\nremote Falkland Islands hardly look like something to fight over,\\nand yet here we are watching another crisis take place.  We are\\nwatching as war erupts between Great Britain and Argentina.\\n\\n   The Thatcher government is acting as if it has forgotten all\\nabout its usual preoccupation with the Soviet threat at NATO\\'s\\ndoorstep.  Instead, Britain is throwing almost everything it\\'s\\ngot at Argentina---aircraft carriers, cruisers, destroyers,\\nsubmarines, assault ships--you name it.  Luxury cruise ships have\\neven been commissioned and turned into troop carriers overnight. \\nWave after wave of additional assault troops have been activated\\nand sent to join the fleet even after it sailed.  Ships and\\nsubmarines have been pulled off station from normal NATO duty and\\nsent to reinforce the task force.  The initial 40-ship force has\\ngrown steadily over the past several weeks into an armada\\nnumbering over 70.  Over two-thirds of the entire Royal Navy has\\nalready been deployed to the South Atlantic off Argentina.\\n\\n   Watching all this, a lot of people are asking: What\\'s this\\nfight really all about?  The most popular answer suggested in the\\nmajor media is \"oil.\"  Vast deposits of oil are known to exist\\nunder the continental shelf between Argentina and the Falklands,\\nbut that has been known for nearly 10 years.  In no way does it\\nexplain the timing of the sudden military offensive by Argentina\\nthis month, and oil explains even less about the Argentine\\nseizure of South Georgia Island.\\n\\n   South Georgia Island is 800 miles east of the Falklands with\\nno known oil deposits anywhere near it; and compared to South\\nGeorgia, the Falklands are an island paradise.  South Georgia\\nIsland is covered with rugged mountains, treacherous valleys,\\nglaciers, and semi-permanent snow.  Most of it is uninhabitable. \\nOn top of all that, Argentina has absolutely no legal or\\nhistorical claim to South Georgia Island.  In that respect it\\nstands in sharp contrast to the Falklands.\\n\\n   In the early 1830s the Falklands were occupied for a while by\\nArgentine colonists.  In 1833 the British expelled them and took\\nover the Island.  For that and other historical reasons,\\nArgentina argues that the Falklands really belong to Argentina,\\nnot Britain.\\n\\n   But no such argument is possible for South Georgia Island.  It\\nhas always been controlled by Britain, never by Argentina or\\nSpain.  The Argentine seizure of South Georgia Island looks even\\nmore unreasonable from a military point of view.  Argentina\\'s\\nleaders are military men and they think in military terms.  They\\nwere well aware ahead of time that far-off South Georgia Island\\ncould not possibly be held for long.  By seizing it they were\\nsetting themselves up to absorb a military defeat, as the Island\\nwas retaken by Britain.  So the question is: Why did Argentina\\'s\\nmilitary junta bother with the seemingly worthless South Georgia\\nIsland at all?\\n\\n   My friends, the answers to all these questions are military,\\nnot political or economic.  South Georgia Island possesses an\\nenormous military secret.  It\\'s a giant underground installation\\nburied under the mountains at the northwest end of the Island. \\nThe real reason for the so-called Falkland crisis is this secret\\ninstallation, together with two other similar installations which\\nI will describe shortly.\\n\\n   The secret military complexes have been in existence for many\\nyears; they are not new.  What is new is the accelerated nuclear\\nwar timetable of the American Bolshevik war planners here in\\nWashington.  For the past two months I\\'ve been reporting the\\ndetails of this new war plan to you as quickly as I can obtain\\nand verify them.\\n\\n   The plan calls for NUCLEAR WAR ONE to erupt by September of\\nthis year 1982!!  It is this fast-approaching nuclear war threat\\nthat caused the so-called Falklands crisis to erupt now.\\n\\n   What is going on now is a coordinated effort to spoil part of\\nthe Bolshevik grand strategy for the coming nuclear war.  The\\nmutual enemies of the American Bolsheviks here--namely, the\\nRockefeller cartel--and Russia\\'s new rulers in the Kremlin are\\nbehind the present crisis.  They are trying to ruin Phase #3 of\\nthe \"PROJECT Z\" war plan which I revealed last month.  That phase\\nis to be world domination by the American Bolsheviks after both\\nRussia and the United States have been destroyed in NUCLEAR WAR\\nONE.  As I mentioned last month, the key to this plan is the\\nexistence of secret weapons stockpiles in various places around\\nthe world.\\n\\n   The American Bolshevik military planners here in America are\\nworking with other Bolshevik agents in key military positions of\\nother countries to set off war.  Having done that, they intend to\\nride out the nuclear holocaust they have caused, safe and cozy in\\nGovernment war bunkers!  When the warring nations finally lie\\nsmoldering and exhausted, the Bolsheviks will leave the shattered\\nremains of their host countries.  They will rendezvous at the\\nsecret weapons installations and bring their weapons into the\\nopen.  They will confront the world with the only remaining\\nfresh, up-to-date, powerful military force on earth; and using\\nthat military power, they will become the undisputed rulers of\\nthe world--that is, they plan to do all this, and they plan to\\npave the way for world domination very soon by setting off\\nNUCLEAR WAR ONE in a matter of months.  The Rockefeller cartel\\nand Russia\\'s new anti-Bolshevik rulers are working together in a\\nrace against time to try to head off the Bolshevik war plan.\\n\\n   Last month I mentioned that the Bolsheviks here are\\nbenefitting from war preparations which were started by the\\nRockefellers long ago.  It has only been about three years since\\nthe Rockefellers were dislodged as the prime movers of the United\\nStates Government by the Bolsheviks.  Since that time the United\\nStates Government has been a house divided, torn by internal\\npower struggles between rival Bolshevik and Rockefeller factions. \\nBut before that, the United States had been dominated for decades\\nboth economically and politically by the Four Rockefeller\\nBrothers.\\n\\n   In 1961 the Brothers launched a new long-range plan for world\\ndomination.  It was a two-prong strategy, half visible and half\\nsecret, which I first described long ago in AUDIO LETTER No. 28. \\nIt was a plan for the United States to arm to the teeth in secret\\nwhile appearing to disarm gradually.  Without repeating all the\\ndetails, the basic idea was grandiose yet simple.  By\\ndeliberately appearing weak, the Rockefeller-controlled United\\nStates would maneuver itself into a nuclear war with Russia. \\nThen the secret weapons, including superweapons, would be\\nunleashed to smash Russia and take over the world.\\n\\n   When they set the grand plan in motion in 1961, the\\nRockefeller Brothers were looking ahead to a nuclear war by the\\nlate 1970s.  Their military analysts concluded very early that\\nthe war being planned would have very different effects on the\\nNorthern and Southern Hemispheres.  Both superpowers, the United\\nStates and the Soviet Union, are located well up in the Northern\\nHemisphere; so are the other full-fledged nuclear powers--Great\\nBritain, France, Red China, and India.  By contrast, the\\nstrategic targets for nuclear war in the Southern Hemisphere are\\nrelatively few and far between.  In other words, it was expected\\nthat the coming nuclear war would be essentially a Northern\\nHemisphere war.\\n\\n   In an all-out nuclear holocaust it is known that serious\\nradioactive fallout will gradually spread to affect even areas\\nnot initially hit by war.  But there are limits to how far the\\nwar clouds can spread.  It was discovered long ago that there is\\nvery little mixing between the air of the Northern and Southern\\nHemispheres.  In the northern half of our planet, cold air from\\nthe North Pole works its way southward towards the equator, then\\nit works its way back to the north as warm air.  A mirror image\\nof this process takes up the southern half of the planet. \\nNorthern and Southern Hemisphere air meet in the equatorial zone,\\nbut very little of the air changes places.\\n\\n   The military conclusion, my friends, is this: the coming\\nnuclear war could ruin large areas of the Northern Hemisphere for\\ngenerations to come; but if the calculations are right, the\\nSouthern Hemisphere could escape virtually unaffected by the war. \\nThis was music to the ears of the Four Rockefeller Brothers.  A\\nquick look at the globe of the world shows why.  The Rockefeller\\ncartel has dominated Latin America ever since World War II.  As I\\ndiscussed in my very first monthly AUDIO LETTER, Nelson\\nRockefeller solidified the cartel grip on Latin America during\\nthe war.  He accomplished this as so-called \"Coordinator of\\nHemispheric Defense\" for then-President Franklin D. Roosevelt. \\nSo that takes care of the South American continent and its\\nnatural resources.\\n\\n   Then there is the African continent.  There, too, Rockefeller\\ncontrol was already in effect over wide areas of Black Africa,\\nespecially south of the equator.  All this was thanks to the\\nefforts of John D. Rockefeller III, as I detailed in AUDIO LETTER\\nNo. 36.\\n\\n   Looking around the globe, the most important remaining land\\nmasses from the standpoint of world domination are Australia and\\nNew Zealand.  Thanks to World War II, both were wide open to the\\nRockefellers.\\n\\n   The Rockefeller Brothers decided to establish secret military\\ninstallations in the Southern Hemisphere for use after the coming\\nwar.  By this means they expected to become the masters of the\\nsurviving southern half of planet Earth after the Northern\\nHemisphere war.  Then, as the Northern Hemisphere gradually\\nrecovered from the nuclear holocaust, the Rockefeller empire\\nwould be able to pick up the pieces.  In this way the third\\ngeneration Rockefeller Brothers expected their family dynasty to\\ninherit the Earth.\\n\\n   In order to control the Southern Hemisphere militarily after\\nthe war, some means would have to be available to project\\nmilitary power onto any land mass.  For example, revolts against\\nRockefeller domination would require troops--not a blast from the\\nbeam weapons on the Moon.  The most critical factor for postwar\\nmilitary domination of the world was found to be a navy.  A\\nminimum of two secret naval fleets would be required--one based\\nin the South Atlantic, the other in the South Pacific.  Since the\\nreserve naval fleets were to be kept secret until after the\\nNorthern Hemisphere nuclear war, they could not be built in\\nexisting shipyards.  New construction facilities had to be built\\nand they had to be hidden.  To hide an entire shipyard is no\\nsmall task; they take up a lot of space.  On top of that, it was\\nessential that the ships remain hidden after they were built. \\nThe best way to achieve that was to combine the shipyard and\\nnaval base into one over-all secret installation.  Finally, the\\nsecret naval installation had to be invulnerable to nuclear\\nattack; otherwise if its existence were ever discovered\\nprematurely, the secret navy might be wiped out.\\n\\n   The combined requirements for secrecy, space, and protection\\nagainst attack were formidable; but one day in 1959, while all\\nthese plans were still in the early stages of development, the\\nanswer presented itself.  During a so-called banking trip to\\nSweden, David Rockefeller was given a tour of a unique hidden\\nnaval port.  The port is hollowed out from solid granite cliffs\\nwhich come right down to the water.  The entrance to the port is\\na gigantic hole in the side of the cliff which can be sealed off\\nwith enormous steel doors.  Inside this big doorway on the water\\na huge cavity has been hollowed out to accommodate ships.\\n\\n   The Rockefeller Brothers and their military adviser decided\\nthat a bigger, more secret, better protected version of the\\nSwedish hidden port was just what they wanted.  A survey of\\ncandidate sites was then initiated.  The site survey covered\\ncoastal areas throughout the Southern Hemisphere.  Many areas\\nwere rejected very quickly because the topography was wrong. \\nOther areas were rejected because they were too close to the\\nequator.  Still others had to be ruled out because there were too\\nmany people living nearby, making the desired level of secrecy\\nimpossible.  Finally, it was essential that the sites chosen for\\nthe secret naval installations be totally secure politically.\\n\\n   At last the sites for the secret naval installations were\\nselected.  In the South Pacific, extreme southern New Zealand was\\nselected.  This is what I was alluding to in AUDIO LETTER No. 71\\nthree months ago when I called attention to New Zealand\\'s extreme\\nimportance in the coming war.\\n\\n   In order to obtain the necessary space, the secret New Zealand\\nnaval installation had to be divided up into two sites located\\nclose together.  One is at the extreme southwest tip of South\\nIsland where the mountain range known as the Southern Alps comes\\ndown virtually to the water\\'s edge.  The other part of the\\ninstallation is built into the northwest tip of Stewart Island,\\nwhich is off the tip of South Island.  The Stewart Island\\nfacility is hollowed out within a rise known as Mt. Anglem.\\n\\n   The New Zealand location met all the requirements.  Ever since\\nWorld War II the government of New Zealand has been tied even\\ncloser to the United States than to Great Britain.  The location\\nis far from the equator, and the installations are buried deep\\nunder mountains, protected from nuclear attack.  They are also\\ntoo deep to be reached by particle-beam attacks, and the New\\nZealand site is well situated to command the entire South\\nPacific.\\n\\n   In the South Atlantic an even more perfect site was found. \\nThat site, my friends, is South Georgia Island.  It is located\\nperfectly for naval domination of the entire South Atlantic.  The\\ntall, rugged mountains provided a perfect location for the secret\\ninstallation at the northwest tip of the 100-mile long island. \\nIt is controlled by Great Britain whose government, like that of\\nNew Zealand, was willing to cooperate; and South Georgia Island\\nwas virtually uninhabited except for a whaling station on the\\nnortheast coast.  The whaling station was some 50 miles away from\\nthe secret new installation which was being built, but Britain\\ntook no chances.  In 1965 the whaling station was closed down. \\nSince that time there have been no inhabitants on South Georgia\\nIsland except for a few dozen alleged Antarctic scientists.\\n\\n   Construction of the secret naval facilities--two in New\\nZealand, one on South Georgia Island--began in the early 1960\\'s. \\nThe techniques were adapted from those used previously to build\\nother large underground facilities, such as the NORAD\\ninstallation inside Cheyenne Mountain, Colorado; however these\\ntechniques were adapted in radically new ways to achieve\\nconstruction access directly from the sea instead of overland. \\nIn this way, the sheltering mountain was left undisturbed in\\nappearance both during and after construction.\\n\\n   The cuts in the mountain side which were necessary to let\\nships in and out were kept as small as possible and were well\\ncamouflaged.  Like the Swedish hidden naval port arrangement, the\\nentrances to the secret installations can be sealed up.  When\\nsealed, the entrance is virtually impossible to detect unless you\\nknow exactly where it is; and unlike most large construction\\nprojects, there are no tailings or piles of leftover rock lying\\naround to attract attention.  The man-made caverns which house\\nthe secret naval installations are enormous, but all the rock and\\ndebris was disposed of at sea.\\n\\n   Once the secret naval facilities were built, they had to be\\noutfitted for ship construction and docksite storage.  The fake\\ndisarmament of the United States during the 1960s contributed\\ngreatly to this task.  From 1961 to 1968 one man played a pivotal\\nrole in this elaborate Rockefeller scheme.  He was then-Secretary\\nof Defense Robert McNamara.  All through the 60\\'s McNamara\\npresided over the public paring back of America\\'s visible\\nmilitary power.  This included the closing down and dismantling\\nof entire shipyards.  What we were not told was where all that\\nshipyard equipment went afterwards.  Where it went, my friends,\\nwas to the new secret installations which were being outfitted in\\nNew Zealand and South Georgia Island!\\n\\n   The secret naval installations have been used as duplication\\nfacilities to reproduce certain ships and submarines designed and\\nbuilt here in the United States.  As Defense Secretary Caspar\\nWeinberger told Congress recently, it is cheaper to build two\\nships at a time.  That is especially true if the second ship is\\nan exact duplicate of the first.  This has become even more true\\nin recent years through the use of computerized manufacturing\\ntechniques.\\n\\n   The secret naval fleets which have been built at the secret\\ninstallations are made up of duplicates--exact duplicates of\\ncertain other ships and submarines.  They are all nuclear\\npowered--nuclear \"subs\"; nuclear cruisers; nuclear destroyers;\\nand yes, nuclear aircraft carriers, three of them.  A secret twin\\nwas built for the U.S.S. Nimitz, for the U.S.S. Eisenhower, and\\nfor the newly-launched U.S.S. Carl Vincent.  All have been\\nfinanced through the gigantic cost overruns, so called, that we\\nconstantly hear about in the Defense Department; and all three\\ncarriers have been provided with a full complement of aircraft\\nwhose manufacture was financed the same way!\\n\\n   The ships of the secret American Bolshevik naval fleets are\\nall duplicates of other nuclear-powered vessels.  Even so, the\\nsecret naval ships possess one key difference.\\n\\n   Last month I revealed that the so-called \"Stealth Program\" has\\nsucceeded in developing a kind of electromagnetic invisibility\\nshield.  This technique makes an object invisible from a distance\\nby distorting light waves in its vicinity.\\n\\n   A whole new fleet of Phantom war-planes are now going into\\ncrash production that use this principle; and, my friends, all of\\nthe secret American Bolshevik navy ships have already been\\noutfitted with similar Stealth-field equipment!  The Stealth\\nprinciple is actually easier to apply to ships than to airplanes\\nbecause there is more room for the powerful equipment that\\ngenerates the field.\\n\\n   After NUCLEAR WAR ONE, the secret Stealth navy of the American\\nBolsheviks would be light years ahead of any other navy left on\\nearth.  It would be perfect for the intended role of world\\ndomination.  The Rockefellers set it all in motion long ago, my\\nfriends, but three years ago they lost control of the United\\nStates Military.  Now it\\'s the American Bolsheviks who are in\\ncontrol, and they are bent on war.\\n\\n   These secret naval installations have precipitated what is\\nbeing called the \"Falklands crisis.\"\\n\\nTopic #2--In AUDIO LETTER(R) No. 73 last month I described\\n\"PROJECT Z\", the new Bolshevik three-phase strategy for NUCLEAR\\nWAR ONE.\\n\\n   An elite group of American Bolshevik military planners here\\nare flushing out the plan right now at a secret war-room here in\\nWashington.  It\\'s a plan by which the United States will strike\\nthe first nuclear blow, followed by all-out thermonuclear war\\nwith Russia.\\n\\n   Having set off the holocaust, the Bolsheviks here and in\\ncertain other countries plan to rise it out safe in comfortable\\nwar bunkers.  Finally after NUCLEAR WAR ONE fizzles out in\\nstalemate, they plan to leave behind the ashes of the United\\nStates and her allies.  Activating Phase #3 of their grand\\nstrategy, they plan to unveil their secret weapons, especially\\ntheir secret naval fleets.  With these they plan to conquer and\\nrule what is left of the world.  The United States as we know it\\nwill be dead and gone; but in the eyes of the Bolsheviks\\nthemselves, this outcome will constitute victory.\\n\\n   Up to now the nuclear war timetable which I first revealed two\\nmonths ago is still on track.  They are still shooting for\\nnuclear war to begin by September of this year 1982!  Time is\\nfast running out.\\n\\n   The Bolsheviks here are sprinting as fast as they can toward\\nwar; but, my friends, the Bolsheviks are not the only runners in\\nthis race.  They have two deadly enemies, both of whom are\\nequally determined to trip up the Bolsheviks.  One enemy of the\\nBolsheviks here is the Rockefeller cartel; the other enemy is the\\nnew anti-Bolshevik ruling clique in Russia; and now these two\\nmutual enemies of the Bolsheviks are pooling their efforts in\\ncertain ways.\\n\\n   In AUDIO LETTER No. 71 three months ago I reported that a\\nlimited, new anti-Bolshevik coalition was in the works between\\nthe Rockefeller cartel and the Russians.  The January 26 meeting\\nbetween Haig and Gromyko in Geneva, Switzerland, was a turning\\npoint in the formation of this coalition.  It is now a reality,\\nand is responsible for the so-called \"Falkland crisis\" now\\ndominating the headlines.  It should be emphasized that this new\\nrelationship between the Rockefeller cartel and Russia falls far\\nshort of a true alliance.  They have very major disputes to be\\nsettled between them, but for the time being they have called a\\ntruce between themselves to deal with their mutual deadly\\nenemy--the Bolsheviks here in America.\\n\\n   The first priority of the Russians and the Rockefellers is to\\nslow down the Bolshevik preparations for imminent nuclear war. \\nIf they can do that, time is on the side of the Rockefeller\\ncartel in certain political movements which I discussed last\\nsummer in AUDIO LETTER No. 67.  A slow-down in the nuclear war\\ntimetable will also give more breathing space for additional\\nanti-Bolshevik actions to be implemented.\\n\\n   The joint Rockefeller-Russian planners decided by mid-February\\nthat military action against the Bolsheviks was essential very\\nquickly.  No other type of action had any hope of taking effect\\nfast enough to prevent nuclear war by the end of this summer.\\n\\n   The exact details of the \"PROJECT Z\" war plan are not known to\\neither the Rockefellers or the Russians, but the general outlines\\nare known to be as I described last month.\\n\\n   It was decided that military action should be devised that\\nwould undermine Phase #3 of the Bolshevik war plan--that is, the\\nBolshevik-controlled secret naval installations and fleets in the\\nSouthern Hemisphere should be attacked and crippled.  By working\\ntogether, the Rockefeller cartel and the Russians were able to\\ndevise an attack plan which neither could have carried out alone. \\nThe Rockefeller group, who built and originally controlled these\\nbases, provided detailed Intelligence about the best way to\\nattack them.  The Russians with their enormous military machine\\nprovided the muscle to actually carry out the attack.\\n\\n   It was essential to devise a scheme that would enable both\\nsecret fleets in the South Atlantic and South Pacific to be\\nattacked.  Survival intact of either fleet would leave the\\nBolshevik war plan still workable.\\n\\n   Military analysts concluded very quickly that a direct assault\\non the New Zealand facilities was out of the question.  There was\\nno combination of commandos, frogmen, or other military force\\nwhich could possibly keep an attack secret from the outside\\nworld.  Any attack on the New Zealand bases would set off the\\nvery war which the Rockefellers and Russians want to prevent.\\n\\n   But the situation in the South Atlantic was a different\\nmatter.  In a way, the greatest asset of South Georgia Island was\\nalso its Achilles\\' heel.  The extreme isolation which protected\\nthe secrecy of the South Georgia base also made a covert military\\nassault feasible.  The key lay with Argentina and her\\nlong-standing claims to the Falkland Islands.\\n\\n   As I mentioned in Topic #1, the Rockefeller cartel has\\ndominated all of Latin America for decades.  Cartel operatives\\nwere sent to Argentina to work out a deal with the government\\nmilitary junta there.  The historic dispute over the Falkland\\nIslands was to be used to provide a ruse, a military cover, to\\nenable the South Georgia base to be attacked.  The Argentine\\ngenerals were not told everything about the situation by any\\nmeans, but they were told enough to make clear what they were to\\ndo.\\n\\n   As an inducement to cooperate, the Argentine leaders were\\npromised handsome rewards.  They were guaranteed that after the\\nshooting was over, the Falkland Islands would remain in Argentine\\nhands.  This guarantee included the promise of covert military\\nassistance as needed against the Royal Navy.  And to bolster the\\ntroubled Argentine economy, it was promised that the Rockefeller\\ncartel will help develop the immense offshore oil reserves.  With\\nthese combined promises of military glory and financial rewards,\\nthe Argentine military junta agreed to the plan.\\n\\n   On March 19 Argentina carried out Act #1 in the joint attack\\nplan.  A group of Argentine scrap-metal merchants, of all things,\\nlanded at the abandoned old whaling station on South Georgia\\nIsland.  Supposedly they were there to dismantle the old\\nbuildings and cart them off to sell.  While they were at it they\\nalso raised the Argentine flag over the work-site.  The British,\\nalways nervous about South Georgia Island, promptly reacted as\\nexpected.  The British Antarctic survey ship \"Endurance\" put 22\\nMarines ashore.  They drove off the scrap merchants and tore down\\nthe Argentine flag.\\n\\n   The incident provided the desired excuse for the Argentine\\nJunta to bring the simmering 150-year-old Falklands dispute to a\\nboil.  From time to time in the past, Argentina has claimed that\\nSouth Georgia is part of the Falklands because it is administered\\nthat way by Britain.  That argument is very flimsy but it now\\ncame in very handy.  It was nothing new to hear this from\\nArgentine leaders, so there was no hint of what was really afoot.\\n\\n   During late March, Argentine military forces started\\nassembling for an assault on the Falklands.  \"Nothing new\",\\nthought the British high command.  Argentina has carried out\\nthreatening maneuvers in the past many times.  It was believed\\nthat they were about to do it again; but on April 2 Argentine\\nforces did the unexpected.  After many past false alarms, this\\ntime they actually invaded and seized the Islands.  All Argentine\\npublic statements emphasized the long-standing historical claims\\nto the Falklands themselves; but just for good measure, the next\\nday a small Argentine force also seized far-off South Georgia\\nIsland.  The force was so small that it gave the appearance\\ninitially that it was just a side show from Argentina\\'s point of\\nview; however, the small contingent of 22 Royal Marines were\\noverpowered and bundled off the Island along with a group of 13\\nalleged scientists.  That was the moment of payoff in the joint\\nRockefeller-Russian attack plan.\\n\\n   Thanks to the elaborate distraction staged by the Argentine\\nforces, a special commando team got onto the Island undetected. \\nBased on the detailed Rockefeller information about the base, the\\nteam moved to a location on the mountain directly above the\\ncavernous secret base.  Special high-speed drilling equipment was\\nset up by the Rockefeller members of the team while the Russian\\nmembers concentrated on military defense.  By late that evening,\\nApril 3, the military high command in London finally learned what\\nwas really taking place.  The secret South Georgia base was under\\nattack by virtually the only means possible.  The joint\\nRockefeller-Russian team were drilling a shaft down through the\\nmountain toward the hollowed out cavern inside.  It was only a\\nmatter of time until their drill would break through the ceiling\\nof the giant hidden naval base.  Once the hole was made, the next\\nstep was obvious.  The Rockefeller-Russian team would put a\\nweapon of some kind through the hole.  The best guess was that it\\nwould be a nerve gas.\\n\\n   The shock waves that went through the highest levels of the\\nBritish government on the evening of April 3 can hardly be\\ndescribed, my friends.  The Thatcher government, like the\\nso-called Reagan Administration here in America, is Bolshevik\\ncontrolled.  That\\'s why Margaret Thatcher always says, \"Me, too\"\\nany time the Reagan Administration says or does anything against\\nRussia.  Both governments are party to the secret nuclear war\\nplan in complete betrayal of the people of their respective\\ncountries, and on the evening of April 3 they suddenly discovered\\nthat their precious war plan was in deep, deep trouble.\\n\\n   Immediately the Thatcher government started assembling a naval\\narmada to sail for the South Atlantic.  Haste was the order of\\nthe day.  The drilling on South Georgia Island was proceeding\\naround the clock.  The best estimates were that the drilling\\nwould break through into the roof of the naval base in about\\nthree weeks, on or about April 24.  If help did not reach South\\nGeorgia by then, the secret installation might be doomed.  The\\nforces stationed at the installation itself were unable to defend\\nthemselves under the circumstances.  Their mighty naval ships\\nwere ships in a bottle.  They did not dare open the bottle to\\nsail out to fight because the Russian commandos were armed with\\ntactical and nuclear weapons.  To open the blast-proof entrance\\ndoors would be suicide.\\n\\n   On April 5, just two days after South Georgia Island was\\nseized, some 40 naval ships began moving out of British ports. \\nThe same day Lord Carrington was sacked as Foreign Minister.  He\\nwas forced to resign, my friends, because he had assisted the\\nRockefeller attack plan by downplaying the Argentine attack\\npreparations.\\n\\n   That same day, April 5, New Zealand, the home of the other\\nsecret naval fleet, broke diplomatic relations with Argentina. \\nThe two hidden New Zealand facilities had been placed on \"Red\\nAlert.\"  As a precautionary measure, all submarines at the twin\\nbase were ordered to sea.  Several surface ships were already at\\nsea undergoing \"sea trials\", but that still left seven (7) major\\nships inside the hidden twin naval base including one of the\\nnuclear aircraft carriers I mentioned earlier.\\n\\n   On that busy day of April 5, Argentina\\'s Foreign Minister,\\nCosta Mendez, was at the United Nations in New York.  He was\\nalarmed by the deployment of such a large part of the Royal Navy. \\nCosta Mendez hurried here to Washington to seek reassurances from\\ncertain officials.  He got them!\\n\\n   For the next two weeks or so the news was filled with stories\\nabout the allegedly slow movement of the British fleet while\\nnegotiations went on.  That, my friends, was only a cover story. \\nThe Royal Navy was actually joining up and moving as rapidly as\\npossible toward South Georgia Island.  If the task force arrived\\nin time to save the secret base, a major battle was likely.  The\\nofficial stories about \"slow movement\" of the British armada were\\nintended to give a cushion of time for that battle.  If need be,\\nthe fleet would have several days to retake South Georgia Island,\\nthen it could move on to arrive near the Falklands on the\\nannounced schedule.  In this way the crucial importance of South\\nGeorgia Island would be hidden and the big secret preserved.\\n\\n   It was initially expected that advance elements of the British\\nfleet would reach the vicinity of South Georgia Island within two\\nweeks.  That would have been soon enough to attack the joint\\nRockefeller-Russian commando team and stop the drilling before it\\nwas completed.  But Russian Cosmospheres and submarines made a\\nshambles of the plan.\\n\\n   Key advance elements of the South Georgia attack contingent\\nleft Ascension Island early April 14, two days before it was\\nannounced officially.  Shortly after they did so, they ran into\\ntrouble.  Russian Cosmospheres and attack submarines closed in on\\na single ship which was critical to the planned counterassault on\\nSouth Georgia Island.  The Cosmospheres bombarded the bridge and\\ncombat information center of the ship with neutron radiation.  In\\nmoments the ship was without any command, its communications and\\nradar silenced.  Then a Russian \"sub\" closed in and quickly\\nfinished off this key British ship with torpedoes.  It broke\\napart with secondary explosions and sank rapidly.  So far as is\\nknown, there were no survivors.\\n\\n   This unexpected shock in the mid-Atlantic produced two\\nresults, both important:\\n\\nFirst, it caused a slowdown in the race toward the South Atlantic\\nby the British armada.  The task force had to be regrouped into a\\nconfiguration better suited for an enroute defense, but that cost\\nvaluable time.  Public announcements from London about the\\nprogress of the fleet reflected this slowdown.  The timetable for\\narrival on battle stations near the Falklands started stretching\\nout longer and longer.  All this bought extra time for the joint\\ncommando team on South Georgia Island.  The drilling continued.\\n\\nThe other result of the sinking was equally important.  Word was\\nflashed to the South Pacific Stealth navy to prepare for possible\\naction.  It was obvious that the Russian Navy was getting\\ninvolved in the Atlantic, which meant that the Royal Navy could\\nbe in big trouble.  During the dead of night, early April 15, the\\nseven Stealth ships put to sea from their twin secret bases in\\nsouthern New Zealand.  They deployed to a secret operational\\nheadquarters area in the Antipodes Islands, 450 miles southeast\\nof New Zealand.  Their electromagnetic shields were operating to\\nprovide protection from attack.  These shields make it impossible\\nto communicate with the outside world or even to see it, as I\\nexplained last month; but once they arrived at the Antipodes, the\\nStealth ships hooked up to buoys equipped with shielded\\ncommunication cables to the Island headquarters.  The Antipodes\\nheadquarters, in turn, was in constant touch with the South\\nGeorgia base by way of a transoceanic cable around the tip of\\nSouth America.  The deployment of the available ships of the\\nSouth Pacific Stealth fleet was exactly what the joint\\nRockefeller-Russian planners had hoped for.  The ships had been\\nflushed out from their essentially invulnerable hiding place in\\nNew Zealand!\\n\\n   The British ship\\'s sinking of April 14 was also followed by\\nother events.  On April 15 the Argentine Navy started moving out\\nof port.  The same day, Alexander Haig arrived again in Buenos\\nAires.  Supposedly he was there as a diplomat, but in reality he\\nwas there as a General, dealing with Generals.  Haig is the top\\nGovernmental operative of the Rockefeller cartel, as I have\\nrevealed in the past.  He was making sure that the Argentines did\\nnot get cold feet and back down at that critical moment.  Four\\ndays later, April 19, Haig left for Washington.  As he boarded\\nhis plane, Haig somberly told reporters, \"Time is running out.\" \\nAnd so it was, my friends, for the secret South Georgia base.\\n\\n   The very next day, April 20, the drill broke through into the\\nhollowed-out cavern of the naval base.  Bolshevik military\\nanalysts in London had not expected that it could be completed\\nuntil at least the following weekend.  The British fleet was\\nstill out of range.\\n\\n   The weapon which the commando team inserted down through the\\nlong hole was a small, compact Russian neutron bomb.  When it was\\ndetonated inside the confines of the huge artificial cave, the\\neffects were devastating.  The intense radiation instantly killed\\neveryone inside the base.  Also the heat and blast effects of the\\nbomb are believed to have damaged all the ships inside\\nsufficiently to badly disable them.\\n\\n   Meanwhile, Russian Cosmospheres and submarines were converging\\non the Stealth ships which were near the Antipodes Islands\\nawaiting orders.  From a distance, the ships were invisible to\\nthe eye due to their protective shields, which also protect\\nagainst beam-weapon attack; but they were sitting ducks for the\\ntactics which the Russians employed.\\n\\n   Floating overhead, the Cosmospheres located the seven ships\\nusing their Psychoenergetic Range-Finding equipment known as PRF. \\nAs I have reported in the past, there is no method known by which\\nPRF can be jammed.  The Cosmospheres radioed the exact locations\\nof the ships to the attack submarines.  The \"subs\" were armed\\nwith special non-homing, non-nuclear torpedoes designed to\\nexplode on impact.  More sophisticated torpedoes would have been\\nthrown off course or detonated prematurely by the protective\\nshield of each ship; but these simple torpedoes just cruise right\\nthrough each invisibility field to strike the ship and explode. \\nWithin 15 minutes after the attack began, all seven Bolshevik\\nStealth ships were on their way to the bottom, and with them went\\ntheir Bolshevik Commanders and mercenary crews collected from\\naround the world.\\n\\n   The South Pacific action took place just after sunset local\\ntime.  The time here in Washington was around 2:00 P.M. April 23. \\nThat evening Secretary of State Haig was seen briefly in public\\nwith the new British Foreign Minister, Francis Pym.  Pym was\\nwearing the artificial pseudo-smile which diplomats are taught\\nalways to display in public.  But not Haig.  Haig was grinning\\nfrom ear to ear, and no wonder.  The joint Rockefeller-Russian\\nmilitary operation had been a brilliant success.  The secret\\nBolshevik South Atlantic fleet had been virtually wiped out,\\nbottled up inside South Georgia Island; and the South Pacific\\nfleet, while not totally wiped out, had been badly crippled.  By\\nworking together, the Rockefeller cartel and the Russians had won\\nthe secret naval war of the Southern Hemisphere.\\n\\nTopic #3--As I say these words, news reports give the impression\\nthat war is about to erupt in the South Atlantic, but the real\\nwar in the Southern Hemisphere is already over.  What we are\\nwatching now is the beginning of its bloody aftermath.  That\\naftermath is the battle for the Falkland Islands.  They have been\\npromised to Argentina as a reward for her role in the secret war.\\n\\n   At this moment the Bolsheviks here in Washington are pressing\\nfor a public announcement that the United States will side with\\nBritain.  As soon as that takes place, military action will heat\\nup fast around the Falklands.  Britain has no choice but to\\nfight.  She has already suffered casualties which cannot be\\nexplained without a public battle; but by fighting, the\\nBolsheviks in Britain are running the risk of a humiliating and\\ntragic defeat for the Royal Navy.\\n\\n   Meanwhile, the Rockefeller strategists here are now\\nconcentrating on a fast-building, anti-nuclear-war campaign.  On\\nall sides now we are hearing about the so-called \"nuclear freeze\\nmovement.\"  There are documentaries, articles, publicity of all\\nkinds to sensitize us to the terrors of nuclear war.  In recent\\nmonths, there have even been referenda popping up on election\\nballots dealing with the nuclear war issue.  Medical doctors are\\nbanding together to warn the public about what would happen if\\nthere were a nuclear war.\\n\\n   We are being told that all this is just popping up\\nspontaneously.  We are now 37 years into the nuclear age and\\nnothing like this has ever gained so much momentum before, yet\\nnow we are supposed to believe that millions of Americans have\\nspontaneously gotten the same ideas at the same time.  If you\\nbelieve that, my friends, I give up.  Movements like this never,\\nand I mean never, develop without leadership, organization, and\\nmoney--and plenty of it.\\n\\n   What we are watching is the Rockefeller public relations\\nmachine at work.  As I\\'ve explained in the past, the Rockefeller\\ncartel cannot afford to let a nuclear war take place.  If it\\ndoes, they will lose everything because they are not in a\\nposition to control it.  Instead, the deadly enemies of the\\nRockefeller cartel, the Bolsheviks here, will win out if there is\\na war; and so the Rockefeller faction is now doing everything in\\nits power to prevent a nuclear war.\\n\\n   The present anti-nuclear-war orientation of the Rockefeller\\ncartel creates certain temporary common interests between them\\nand Russia; but as Russia\\'s new rulers know very well, this does\\nnot spring from any great moral perspective on the part of the\\nRockefeller group.  It\\'s purely a matter of practical necessity\\nright now for the Rockefellers.\\n\\n   The Russians regard the United States as a house divided, and\\nthey are exploiting that division by working in careful ways with\\nthe Rockefellers.  Their first priority is to rid the world of\\nthe deadly Bolshevik menace of all-out, even suicidal, nuclear\\nwar; but once that is done, they know that there will be a day of\\nreckoning with the Rockefeller cartel some day.\\n\\n   The Rockefeller group is working toward a definite objective\\nwith their new anti-nuclear-war propaganda.  That objective is\\nrenewed power--and power that moves them closer to their old\\ndream of WORLD GOVERNMENT.  The Bolsheviks here have unwittingly\\nprovided fertile ground for the powerful new Rockefeller antiwar\\ncampaign.  Under Bolshevik control, the so-called Reagan\\nAdministration has become so hawkish that it\\'s scaring people. \\nThe Rockefeller antiwar campaign is designed to capitalize on\\nthat latent fear as a tool of power.\\n\\n   These days the smell of war is in the air.  The Falklands\\ncrisis is helping to make that more intense.  The Rockefeller\\npropaganda machine is now paving the way for the argument that\\nsurrender of sovereignty is the only way to avoid war.  A new\\nsuper-United Nations of sorts is now in the works to fill the\\nbill.  It will have teeth!  As presently envisioned, the new\\norganization will be based in Geneva, Switzerland.  The working\\nname, though this may be changed, is the \"World Nonproliferation\\nCouncil.\"  The plan is to bring it into being as the outgrowth of\\nnuclear nonproliferation treaties, but its true purpose will be\\nto use fear--the fear of war--to control us all.\\n\\n                       LAST MINUTE SUMMARY\\n\\n   Now it\\'s time for my Last Minute Summary.  In this AUDIO\\nLETTER I have reported on the reasons behind the so-called\\nFalkland Islands crisis.  The crisis erupted because of secret\\nBolshevik-controlled naval installations in the Southern\\nHemisphere.  These have been attacked by joint action of the\\nRockefeller cartel and the Russians in an attempt to slow down\\nthe nuclear-war timetable.  The attacks were successful, but the\\nresults remain to be seen.  One result, though, is that the Royal\\nNavy has now been drawn into a trap.  Britain\\'s Waterloo at sea\\nmay well be at hand.\\n\\n   My friends, two factions are struggling for control over our\\nUnited States--the Rockefeller cartel and the Bolsheviks.  They\\ndiffer in style but both seek to control us through fear.  If we\\nare ever to rise above their trickery, it must be through the\\npower of our Lord Jesus Christ, our only hope.  As the Scripture\\ntells us, our Lord \"...has not given us the spirit of fear; but\\nof power, of love, and of a sound mind.\"  We must learn to wage\\npeace.  As our Lord declared long ago, \"Blessed are the\\npeacemakers: for they shall be called sons of God.\"',\n  'a friend of mine has eight (8) 4mb 70ns simms for sale for $105/each or best\\noffer.  since techworks sells these puppies for $140/ea., you may want to\\ncontact him directly at:\\n\\nsteve epstein\\n895-6236 days\\n706-2436 evenings\\n\\nthanks,\\nbruce l.',\n  'kaldis@romulus.rutgers.edu (Theodore A.

It appears that in\\na neutral park Bo\\'s HR and slugging tend to drop (he actually loses two\\nhome runs).  Or do they?  What is \"equivalent average?\"\\n\\nOne thing, when looking at Bo\\'s stats, is that you can see that KC took\\naway some homers.  Normally, you expect some would-be homers to go for\\ndoubles or triples in big parks, or to be caught, and for that matter you\\nexpect lots of doubles and triples anyway.  But Bo, despite his speed, \\nhit very few doubles and not that many triples.  So I would expect his\\nvalue to have risen quite considerably in a neutral park.  \\n\\n\\nFelix Jose has been a .350/.440 player in a fairly neutral park.\\nI would offhand guess the `89-`90 Bo at around a .330/.530 player.\\nMaybe .330/.550 .  Not even close.\\n\\n\\nI\\'d put him about there too.  \\n\\nNote: I hadn\\'t realized the media had hyped him so much.  I thought he\\nwas always viewed by them as a better football player, and only so-so \\nat baseball.  He did only have one 30-hr, 100-rbi season, and KC wasn\\'t\\nwinning.\\n\\nNote 2: I maybe have harped on this a bit in the past, but there is a\\nmistake being made (by the SDCN\\'s, as they are known, on this group)\\nwith respect to players like Bo and Deion and Lofton (and perhaps others).\\n\\nWe find, that if you look at a large group of players, their past major\\nand minor league numbers will predict their future numbers fairly well.\\nTheir are some caveats: the younger they are, the less good the prediction;\\nthe lower the minor league, the less good (I imagine), the more recent\\nthe player has left college ball, etc.\\n\\nNow of course, this prediction involves quite a bit of \"error.\"  Sometimes\\na player with poor MLE\\'s (Dave Justice, the 1990 Ventura) becomes a star.\\nSome hitters develop (Shane Mack, Brian Downing), some don\\'t (Oddibe\\nMcDowell, Mickey Brantley).  This error involves real things: there are\\nreal reasons why Oddibe didn\\'t hit and Shane did.  It may (who knows)\\ninvolve parks and batting coaches and wheaties and injuries and lifting\\nand so on.\\n\\nBut still, you have this big pool of players, and things work pretty well.\\nOne of the reasons for these predictions accuracy is the common background\\nof the players.  One thing we know about professional baseball players is\\nthat all of them (or almost all) have spent a good deal of time playing\\nball.  Their backgrounds are similar.\\n\\nWhat hasn\\'t been established is what happens when you encounter a player\\nwith a different background?  Is there some reason to believe that a\\nBo, or a Deion, or a Lofton, or a Tony Gwynn (?), or an Ainge, or so\\non, has such a different background, that the standard model and standard\\nassumptions fit this person slowly?\\n\\nIt hasn\\'t been established that you can use MLE\\'s with two-sport players.\\n(It hasn\\'t been established that you can\\'t, but then statistics is, after\\nall, an art).  I personally think otherwise lucid individuals continually\\nmake completely nonsensical statements about Bo and Deion and Lofton.\\n\"Look at those good-but-not-great minor league numbers,\" they say.  Well,\\nwhat happens if those numbers simply don\\'t mean what they usually mean?\\nIt might mean that Ken Lofton suddenly has a better year in Houston than\\nTuscon.  It might mean that Deion suddenly has a better half-year in\\nAtlanta than Greenville.  \\n\\nThen again, it might not.  Ken and Deion might go right back in the tank\\nthis year, live up to those poor MLE\\'s.  But you guys DON\\'T KNOW.  What\\'s \\nworse, you don\\'t know that you don\\'t.

So I called them up and I'm going to return it for a new one.\\n\\nMy question is, how often does such a thing happen with SIMM chips in general?\\nDo you often find when ordering chips that a large portion are bad? Is this\\na rarity? This is the first chip I've ordered so I have no other experience\\nin this area. I'm just curious if anyone else has had the same type of\\nexperience.\\n\\nThat's about it. Please email me, and if people want, I can post a summary.\\nThanks all.\\n-- \\nHillel Sims  -----  simsh@rpi.edu  -----  Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute\",\n  \"My wife has one of these.

I think that as we said before, there \\nwere no specific compromises on either side, although it was a very \\ngood discussion about the jobs package and about other issues as \\nwell.  As you know, the President first called Senator Dole I believe \\nTuesday night to talk about the Russian aid package.  They did not \\nspeak -- Senator Dole called him back Wednesday morning -- when the \\nPresident was out.  Instead he spoke with Tony Lake, and at the close \\nof that conversation, indicated that he wanted to speak to the \\nPresident about the jobs and stimulus package.  They finally talked \\nabout that yesterday afternoon.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     At the close of that discussion they said that they \\nwould have another talk last night, which they did, when the Senator \\nwas up in New Hampshire.  And although there were no specific \\ncompromises made on either side, they did say that they would \\ncontinue to have some discussions.

As the President has said \\nconsistently, he intends to come forward with an adjusted package.  \\nHe believes in the package, but he believes that if it\\'s going to \\ntake adjustments to get the minority to release it, he\\'s willing to \\nmake those adjustments.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  On the subject of a VAT --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR.

What is \\nconsidered -- \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Well, he is the one who said, I haven\\'t reviewed \\nit.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That is true.  That is what I just \\nrepeated. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, is there any concern here that as a result \\nof the definite statement he made in February and the promise that if \\nit were to be considered he\\'d let us know, and having it trickle out \\nthe way it did, that there may now be the development of a \\ncredibility gap on this issue and others?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t think so.  I mean, it is \\nnow public knowledge that this is being considered.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is he or you at all embarrassed about the absolute \\nstatements that were made from this platform to the effect that it \\nwas off the table and was not being considered, and then to have it \\ncome out not from you people, but --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, wait a second.  It came out \\nfrom the administration.  What are you talking about?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What I\\'m saying is, though, that the President said \\nhe would let us know. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Right.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  You people then said -- you said, I believe, that \\nit\\'s not going to be on the program.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  On March 25th.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  On March 25th. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Circumstances change.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Well, I understand.  But we have to find that out \\nby rooting around in the fine print of an interview\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Rooting around -- I know you did do \\na very good job there to read the USA Today article.  But this is --\\n(laughter) -- the Deputy Director of the OMB and the Secretary of \\nHealth and Human Services.  I mean, that is common anytime you guys \\nwrite a story that has an unattributed quote from somebody in the \\nClinton administration, the headline is -- I\\'ll look at it right \\nhere, and AP story -- \"Clinton wants more money for spying.\"\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What about his remark that if it were being \\nconsidered, he\\'d tell us about it?  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  And the administration\\'s concerned, \\nand he\\'d let you know.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  And did he?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.  Absolutely.  What did he say \\nthis morning?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  It had to be dragged out of you here yesterday.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It didn\\'t have to be dragged out of \\nme.  We had the Deputy Director of the OMB, we had the Secretary of \\nHealth of Human Services say it was being considered.  That is his \\nadministration.  That is his administration policy.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Were these authorized trial balloons, or were they \\norchestrated leaks?  I mean, what was the --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They were asked questions, they \\nanswered the questions.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  You\\'re saying here that it didn\\'t have to be \\ndragged out, that you more or less made it clear yesterday you were \\nconsidering it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Absolutely.  I was very clear.  \\nPainfully clear.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Was there a particular political strategy in making \\nit clear the administration is considering a new tax increase on tax \\nday?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, it was just this issue is being \\nconsidered.  They were asked if it was being considered; they \\nanswered that it was being considered.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, The New York Times --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Why do it yesterday?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They were asked.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  The New York Times reports today that Secretary \\nReich and the chief economist at the Labor Department used apples and \\noranges numbers in order to portray last month\\'s unemployment figures \\nin a way that was supportive of the President\\'s job stimulus bill, \\nbut which turned out to be totally false.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t know if it was totally \\nfalse, but I think -- (laughter) -- the chief economist at the Labor \\nDepartment did grant that it was an inappropriate mixing, and they \\nsay that. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  The question is, is the President concerned about \\nbehavior that amounts to corrupting government data?  And what\\'s he \\ndoing about it, if so?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The chief economist has said that a \\nmistake was made, it won\\'t happen again, and that\\'s the end of the \\nmatter.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Isn\\'t that the same information that goes to the \\nPresident?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  If I could go back to the stimulus package --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  There\\'s two separate pieces of \\ninformation.  I think that\\'s where the confusion was.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  When did you all first learn about this mistake \\nthat was made?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I read the article this morning.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  And as far as you know, is the President aware of \\nit?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think so.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  And was he aware of it before he read about it in \\nThe New York Times?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t know.  Not to my knowledge.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Did you ever hear about it before this morning?  \\nAnything?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I didn\\'t.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Wasn\\'t the President given an erroneous spin on \\nthis for his own purpose?  For his speeches, for his arguments?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well again, I\\'m not sure.  Both \\nstatements are true.  What the Labor Department has granted is that \\nmixing them in one sentence, essentially, was misleading.  They said \\nit was a mistake.  They said they wouldn\\'t do it again.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Did they drop it -- is this something that you \\nchoose to spin or make an issue of?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Whenever fewer people are out of \\nwork, we\\'re gratified.  But that doesn\\'t take away from the need to \\nget this jobs package going.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  If I could go back to the stimulus package for a \\nminute.  You said that the President plans to come forward with an \\namendment.  Is the timetable still what it was -- that the amendment \\nwould be laid down on Monday and voted on on Tuesday, or did he, in \\nthe conversation with Dole, talk about the possibility of putting \\nthat off for a few more days to give more time for the discussion?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think at this point there\\'s no \\nchanges in the schedule at all.  I don\\'t know that they discussed the \\ntiming like that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Do you believe that you\\'re closer or getting closer \\nthis week than you were last week?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I believe that we\\'re going \\nto pass a jobs package.  The President is prepared to make \\nadjustments in order to get that to happen.  I don\\'t know where the \\nvotes are on cloture at this particular time.  I don\\'t know what\\'s \\ngoing to happen until we have a vote.  But the President believes \\ndeeply in this jobs package and wants to get it done.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Has there been any indication that this situation \\nhas changed?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We\\'re going to continue to work on \\nit.  We\\'ll know when the votes are taken.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, last week you said that there are -- or \\nvarious people in the administration were saying that you couldn\\'t go \\nthrough Dole, you were going to have to try and go around him because \\nhe was immovable on this subject of a compromise, or at least the \\ncompromise he wanted was not anything like the one that you could \\naccept.  This week you\\'re talking to him.  Is that because you\\'ve \\nrealized that the peeling off effort wasn\\'t going to work?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That\\'s because Senator Dole wanted \\nto talk to the President about the stimulus package.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  He initiated the conversation?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Secretary Reich this morning said that, in fact, \\nthe President is not willing to compromise on this bill at all.  You \\nsay he\\'s making --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t know that that\\'s exactly \\nwhat he said.  I think he said he didn\\'t have any indication that \\nthere was any compromises yet or that there would be a compromise, \\nand the President doesn\\'t want to compromise.  And the President \\ndoesn\\'t want to compromise.  But if he has to make adjustments to get \\nit through, he will.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Officials here yesterday said that Panetta was \\nworking on a series of adjustments that might be made public before \\nthe actual vote.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It\\'s possible.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Today?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I\\'m not sure exactly when that will \\nhappen, but I think that it\\'s very possible that we\\'ll come forward \\nwith some sort of a different package, or Senate Democrats will come \\nforward with some sort of a different package in order to get it \\npassed.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  As we understood his conversations with Dole, the \\nfirst one was some discussion of this and I\\'ll get back to you \\ntonight with some details or some adjustments, or whatever the phrase \\nis.  Did he offer him some details or some adjustments?  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think it\\'s a question of how \\ndetailed.  I mean, I think they had a general discussion about the \\npackage last night, subsequent to their conversation yesterday \\nafternoon.  I believe that there will be follow-up discussions today \\nin the Senate, not necessarily between the President and Senator \\nDole.  And let me just reiterate, neither side has made specific \\ncompromises at this date.  When we have something we\\'ll let you know.  \\nAnd I\\'m not suggesting that Senator Dole has accepted anything that \\nwe\\'ve talked about or that we\\'ve offered anything in a hard way.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What are the follow-up discussions if not the \\nPresident and Dole?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think Senator Mitchell is going \\nto talk to Senator Dole.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is that a threat?  (Laughter.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Did the President say to Senator Dole, all right, \\nhow about this number as an overall size, or did Dole say to the \\nPresident, I can go as high as this?  Did they talk numbers?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t think it was a negotiation \\nin that respect.  It was more of a discussion about their positions.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Did they discuss actual numbers?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I\\'m just not sure.  I know they \\ntalked about the basic outlines of the packages.  I think they talked \\nabout the programs they cared about.  I don\\'t know if they got to the \\nlevel of this many x-billion dollars. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Does Dole have to sign off before there is a \\npackage?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, of course not.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Did the White House have anything to do with the \\nprotesters who showed up in New Hampshire today where Senator Dole \\nwas speaking?  Was that in any way organized by --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not to my knowledge, no.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  And has the President been in touch with Senators \\nKohl or Feingold?  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t think he\\'s talked to them, \\nno.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, is the President considering the more \\npalatable fact of having a national sales tax instead of having the \\nhaves having to continuously pay for the have-nots?  And is he going \\nto scrap his proposed tax on the privileged few, with the haves \\nhaving to pay for the have-nots?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President believes deeply that \\nthe tax rates on upper income Americans, as he presented in his \\nbudget, should go up.  And I think for the second half of your \\nquestion, I\\'ll refer you to my briefing from yesterday.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, on the subject of accuracy in information, \\nyou suggested the other day that the stimulus package included money \\nthat would solve the water problem in Milwaukee.  Apparently that is \\nnot true.  It\\'s actually waste water money.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It\\'s waste water money for \\nWisconsin, and some could go to Milwaukee. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  But it would not affect the drinking water problem \\nbecause it\\'s waste water money, right?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It would affect the water treatment \\noverall. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  But the implication from your statement the other \\nday was that it would help fix this disease problem in Milwaukee now.  \\nWould you agree that\\'s not the case?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I\\'m not sure of the specifics.  I \\nknow that it goes to the overall water treatment in Wisconsin.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  A leftover question from this morning, which was, \\nwhen did the President find out that the task force was deliberating \\non a VAT?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I\\'m not sure exactly when.  I just \\ndon\\'t know.  I assume it came up over the last -- certainly between \\nthe time that we had commented on in the past and two days ago.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  So sometime since March 25th?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that\\'s right.  I don\\'t know \\nthe exact date.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, the President this morning mentioned that \\nsome labor and business groups are for the VAT tax.  Apparently, the \\nNational Association of Manufacturers talks about perhaps the VAT tax \\nbeing okay if it replaces the BTU tax.  So does the President feel \\nthat perhaps this might be in place of some other tax he\\'s proposed, \\nor is this totally in addition to the other taxes he\\'s already \\nproposed?  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think we\\'ve said all we have to \\nsay about the VAT at this point.  I mean, there\\'s just no -- this is \\nbeing considered by the health care working groups, and that is all.  \\nThe President hasn\\'t made any further decisions beyond that. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  But it would be to finance health care, it wouldn\\'t \\nbe to replace some other tax that finances -- it wouldn\\'t replace the \\nincome tax, for instance?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  There have been no discussions on \\nthat.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  In terms of getting a VAT tax through Congress, \\nSenator Dole\\'s press release today said VAT -- on tax day.  Do you \\nthink -- does it have a chance of getting through Congress?  Would it \\nhave a chance?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I have no idea. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is that a consideration whether you all put it \\nforward?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That would become a consideration \\nif the President were to decide to do it.  It\\'s not in consideration \\nnow.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  You said at the beginning of the briefing that \\ncircumstances had changed and that had caused the VAT to now be under \\nconsideration.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes, what the President referred to \\nthis morning.  These groups came forward and said this is something \\nthat has to be considered.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Those are the circumstances that have changed?  \\nThat\\'s the only difference between now and when he emphatically ruled \\nit out that groups have asked it to be considered?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That\\'s what he said. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is that true?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Was there, in fact, some understanding that sin \\ntaxes would not produce enough money for the health care benefits?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I\\'m not going to get into the \\ndeliberations.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  But, George --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.  What the consideration is, as \\nthe President said, groups came forward and said this is something \\nyou ought to consider.  The working groups are looking at it. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is that the only thing that\\'s changed since his \\nprior statement and your prior statement on the VAT?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Can you explain how those groups -- how that \\ninformation got to him that groups wanted it?  Was it just reading \\nthe newspaper or did groups make presentations?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think the groups -- as you know, \\nthe health care task force has met with dozens of groups.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  But this is the President\\'s knowledge that these \\ngroups had come forward.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think he was referring to what \\nwas coming to the working groups.  Obviously, there have also been \\npublished positions in the newspapers.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Have certain groups briefed him on the group\\'s \\npresentations to them?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t know if they\\'ve briefed him \\n-- I mean, how detailed the briefings have been.    I know that the \\nworking groups decided to look into this after being pressed by these \\ngroups.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What kind of arguments did the groups make that \\nwere persuasive enough that the President would change the position \\nthat he had enunciated previously?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t know, it\\'s just they\\'ve had \\nlongstanding positions that this would be a good way to finance \\nhealth care.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  The President wasn\\'t aware of those longstanding \\npositions?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He may have been at some level.  \\nObviously, he\\'s been a governor for a long time and he knows the \\nbasic arguments for and against a VAT tax.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What we\\'re trying to figure out here -- you\\'re \\ntelling us that the only change, the only thing that affected this \\nchange in the President\\'s attitude toward the VAT between February \\nand now --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President\\'s attitude hasn\\'t \\nnecessarily changed.  I mean, he has not made a decision.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  I know, but the President said that it was off the \\ntable.  So did you.  And you\\'re saying that the only thing that\\'s \\nchanged is the positions of these groups, except you\\'re also \\ndescribing them as longstanding positions.  I don\\'t see the change.  \\nIf these groups haven\\'t had any change in their position that\\'s been \\nmade to the President --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, they\\'ve made the \\npresentations to the health care task force.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  There\\'s no relationship at all between the fact \\nthat sin taxes that he had said -- suggested in February that he \\nfavored will not produce enough revenue to finance --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t think he ever suggested \\nthat they would produce all the revenue.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Well, he suggested that he thought that those were \\nappropriate ways to finance health care.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He did say that.  I don\\'t know that \\nhe said anything to refute that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  But, in fact, has the task force discovered that \\nthere wouldn\\'t be enough revenue from those taxes to finance the kind \\nof core benefits --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I don\\'t think that the task \\nforce ever suggested that there would.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, if he advocated a VAT tax, would that break \\nhis promise not to raise taxes on the middle class to pay for his \\nprograms?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I can\\'t comment on a hypothetical \\nsituation.\\n\\t     \\t  \\n\\t     Q\\t  But does that promise -- would that promise not to \\nraise taxes on the middle class to pay for the programs prevent him \\nfrom seeking a VAT tax?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President has made no decisions \\non the VAT tax.  When he does, we\\'ll tell you and we\\'ll explain the \\nimplications then.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Which specific groups can you cite -- business, \\nlabor or otherwise -- whose recommendations to the health care task \\nforce has prompted this consideration?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t have the specific.  I just \\ndon\\'t have that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, can you tell us to what extend these other \\nalternatives, for instance, the employer tax or the sin taxes or \\nother financing options are also still on the table and what these \\noptions are?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, as members of the task force \\nand representatives of the working groups have said, they are looking \\nat a wide variety of options.  I think that Ira Magaziner said that \\nthere are 20 different options under consideration.  But I\\'m not \\ngoing to comment --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What\\'s the scope --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I\\'m just not going to comment on \\nthem, no.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What\\'s the scope of the need?  How much are you \\ntalking about that has to be produced by one or a combination of the \\n--\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That\\'s what the health care task \\nforce is looking at.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Since there\\'s not going to be any briefing on the \\nMiyazawa visit, two questions:  One, generally what does the \\nPresident hope to use that meeting for, but more specifically, is his \\ntask complicated by the Japanese anger over the Vancouver note and \\nthe remark about market access at the press conference?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The Vancouver note?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Does no mean yes.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Yes and no.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I don\\'t know.  I saw the \\nPrime Minister\\'s press conference where he was asked the question \\nabout that note and he gave a very gracious and complete answer when \\nhe was asked the question.  The questions of trade are something that \\ncertainly will be discussed between the Prime Minister and the \\nPresident.  There is obviously a trade imbalance between Japan and \\nthe U.S. that we want to do something about.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Also in those comments the Prime Minister made he \\nsuggested that the United States should come down heavy on him in \\nterms of trade.  Are you going to oblige?  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:   I think the President will state \\nour views on trade very clearly and our views on the trade deficit \\nvery clearly.  I don\\'t necessarily want to agree with your \\ncharacterization of the Prime Minister\\'s comments.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     that we need specific export targets, specific \\nnumerical targets -- is that what he\\'s going to discuss with \\nMiyazawa?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They\\'re going to have a broad \\ndiscussion of a wide range of trade issues.  I don\\'t want to get into \\nthose specifics until after the meeting.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Why?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t   That\\'s the crux of the issue, right?  Whether or \\nnot -- does the President believe that without specific numerical \\ntargets, it is really, as he said in his press conference, sort of \\nhopeless that this is going to change very much?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President believes that we must \\nhave pressure on Japan to turn the trade imbalance around.  I do not \\nwant to get into the specifics of how that would be done.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  But does the President believe that their stimulus \\npackage announced yesterday will rectify the imbalance?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think, first, the President wants \\nto get a full briefing on the stimulus package from Prime Minister \\nMiyazawa himself, and then he\\'ll make the comment on it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  How about the Russian aid package?  There seems to \\nbe some confusion about how the U.S. views that, Secretary \\nChristopher saying -- or Bentsen saying the Japanese may need to do \\nmore, the Japanese saying that that\\'s not what they heard?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, we\\'re going to continue to \\nwork with all our allies in the G-7, and we\\'re going to continue to \\npress for help for Russian reform, Russian democratic reform.  And I \\nthink that, so far, we had a very good announcement out of Tokyo and \\nwe\\'re going to continue to work with our allies for bilateral \\npackages.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Do you think the Japanese need to do more?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We\\'re going to continue to work \\nwith all our allies to do as much as we can.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Secretary Christopher was asked today on the Today \\nShow this morning what he thought of Margaret Thatcher\\'s comments on \\nthe Bosnia policy.  And he said, \"It\\'s a rather emotional response.\"  \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Over an emotional issue.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Right -- to an emotional problem.  Does the White  \\nHouse condone that kind of remark?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that Secretary \\nChristopher\\'s remarks speaks for itself.  The President believes also \\nthat this is a deeply troubling situation that we\\'re trying to find \\nanswers for. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  But that specific -- \"rather emotional response\" -- \\nspecific term?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, it speaks for itself.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  In connection with that, doesn\\'t it seem that with \\nthe numbers of people who are being killed at this very moment, is it \\ngood American policy to put off some decisions that might be made now \\nto help Boris Yeltsin win a referendum?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  For example?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  To take stronger action, to take military action -- \\nair strikes, anything that can be done?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President believes that what \\nmust be done now is to push harder for sanctions.  He is also -- as \\nyou know, the administration has been discussing lifting the arms \\nembargo.  He believes those are the appropriate ways to increase \\npressure at this time.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What is your response to the critics who would say \\nthat the U.S. is now stymied by trying to help Boris Yeltsin retain \\nthe presidency?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They\\'re wrong.  We\\'re pressing hard \\nfor the Serbs to come to the negotiating table.  We\\'re pressing hard \\nfor increased sanctions, and we\\'re talking to our allies about the \\narms embargo.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  You were putting great store in Vance and Owen \\ngetting people to agree to that.  Now, Vance and Owen have both said \\nthat military force to some extent would be acceptable.  Does that \\nchange your thinking?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Clearly, we\\'re going to listen to \\nwhatever people who have put so much time into a situation have to \\nsay.  But at this point, the President is moving forward on sanctions \\nand talking about the arms embargo.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  A follow-up on a Dee Dee comment this morning.  She \\nsaid she would be able to provide some administration officials who \\ncould document the effect the sanctions are having in Bosnia.  Are \\nyou going to be able to do that, or do you have anything --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t think that\\'s what she said.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  That\\'s exactly what she said.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t think that\\'s true.  But \\nwhat she said -- we would look into the situation of what kind of \\nevidence can be provided in Bosnia.  Obviously, if there are \\nconnections between the Bosnian Serbs and the Serbs in Belgrade and \\nwe are tightening the screws on the Serbs in Belgrade, that will have \\nan effect over time.  I do not know day by day, minute by minute, \\nwhat kind of help is being given between the two and what the exact \\neffect has been.   But, clearly, we are slowing the shipment of goods \\ninto Belgrade.  We are having an effect on the Serbs there.  What \\nkind of effect that will eventually have on the Bosnian Serbs I don\\'t \\nknow.  But one thing I would say is if it were having no effect at \\nall, I don\\'t know why they\\'d be fighting it so much.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Are the First Lady\\'s tax returns going to be \\nreleased?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think there\\'s a joint tax return.  \\nAnd it will be probably later today.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is the President considering signing an executive \\norder banning discrimination against homosexuals in the federal work \\nforce as part of the gay rights march here next week?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t think there\\'s any proposal \\nfor that at this time, not that I know of.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  It\\'s something that the President promised during \\nthe campaign that he would do.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I have not seen any -- I don\\'t \\nthink it\\'s anything that\\'s on his plate right now.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is he meeting with gay rights leaders at any point \\non this issue?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t know about on this issue.  \\nI assume that he\\'ll meet with representatives of the gay and lesbian \\ncommunity sometime soon, as he meets with representatives of lots of \\ndifferent groups and communities.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Do you know if that\\'s scheduled --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It\\'s probably going to be tomorrow.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Probably going to be tomorrow?  (Laughter.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  It\\'s a good thing you asked.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Who\\'s probably going to be there?  (Laughter.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t know.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  How long --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t know.  That\\'s all I know.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Do you know if it\\'s at 3:00 p.m. tomorrow?  \\n(Laughter.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t know what time it is.  I \\ndon\\'t even know for sure if it\\'s going to be tomorrow.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Environmental groups have asked him to make a major \\nspeech next week of some kind.  Is that going to happen, do you know?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t know if they\\'ve asked, but \\nI think the President has always planned, as he did last year, to \\ngive a speech on Earth Day and I expect that he will.  If it\\'s not \\nexactly on Earth Day, it might be a day before or something like \\nthat.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is he planning to sign or announce the signing of \\nthe biodiversity treaty in connection with Earth Day?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I don\\'t know the specific \\ntiming of something like that, but it\\'s certainly something under \\ndiscussion and something we\\'ve been working on.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Campaign finance reform?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We\\'re working on it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Do you think it will be next week?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I\\'m just not sure.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  The biodiversity treaty is something you\\'re working \\non?  I missed the question.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes, something we\\'re working on.  \\nHe asked if it was ready to be signed, and I said I didn\\'t know \\nanything about that but it\\'s something we\\'ve certainly been working \\non.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Do you know what organizations might be represented \\nin this meeting with the gay and lesbian groups?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Do you know if he is going to reconsider being out \\nof town on the day of the march?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He\\'s got to be at the Senate \\nmeeting in Jamestown, and I believe he\\'s also going to be giving a \\nspeech to the American Association of Newspaper Publishers in Boston \\non Sunday, as he did last year.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Would you have told us if she had not pressed you \\non the question?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  On what?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  On the gays.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  When we went through the \\nPresident\\'s schedule for the day, certainly.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q?\\t    George, what day is the publisher\\'s speech?  Is \\nthat Sunday?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think it\\'s a Sunday.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  And Saturday he\\'ll be in Jamestown?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  So you\\'re just going to be in Jamestown for one \\nday?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, I\\'m not sure.  I don\\'t know how \\nlong the Senate thing goes.  It might go overnight.  I just don\\'t \\nknow.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  You would have made the gay meeting public, right?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I\\'m certain if we had the meeting \\n-- I don\\'t know about open to the press, but we would have told you \\nabout it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  I mean, because it is, as far as I can tell, the \\nfirst time in history a President has met in the Oval Office with --  \\n\\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I didn\\'t say it was going to be in \\nthe Oval Office.  (Laughter.)  But I didn\\'t -- I\\'m not say that it\\'s \\nnot, but I didn\\'t say that it was.  (Laughter.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     at the White House in the Bush administration \\ngay officials were invited to a bill signing ceremony and the White \\nHouse had to repudiate having done that.  So I just wanted to make \\nsure --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the President wouldn\\'t do \\nanything like that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Certainly not.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What marching orders did the President give to \\nGeneral Vessey?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They had a very good discussion for \\nabout half an hour today.  He wanted -- the most important thing was \\nhe had a full accounting for American POWs and MIAs.  He will \\nobviously look into the circumstances surrounding this new document.  \\nThe President stressed that he wanted the fullest possible accounting \\nand said that only when we have that can we even consider any changes \\nin our policy towards Vietnam.  He\\'ll be looking at Vietnam\\'s \\nresponse to the questions raised by the document and he\\'ll also look \\ninto investigations on discrepancy cases, increased efforts on \\nremains, implementing trilateral investigations -- and access to \\nmilitary archives.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     And Ambassador Toon also briefed the President on the \\nactivities of the joint commission and on the document.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Vietnam says it\\'s a fake.  What is the DOD analysis \\nat this stage?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It\\'s not completed yet, and it\\'s \\nalso the first thing that General Vessey will bring up with the \\nVietnamese.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  A number of Defense officials have been saying that \\nthey think that the 600 or so prisoners referred to are, in fact, \\nnon-Americans that the Vietnamese had captured who they referred to \\nas Americans from time to time.  Do people -- \\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We don\\'t have any final \\ndetermination.  We\\'re going to wait for the complete review; when we \\nhave it, we\\'ll make a judgment.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  I know you don\\'t have any final determination, but \\ngiven all of the intense public interest in this, do you think that \\nthat\\'s a likely possibility?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I just don\\'t want to characterize \\nit in any way until the review is complete.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, was there a topic scheduled for the speech \\nin Boston?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is the President going to have a press conference \\ntomorrow with Miyazawa?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think so, but I\\'m not positive.  \\nYes, I expect, yes.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Was Toon in with Vessey?  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  He was in on the meeting?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What was the question?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Was Ambassador Toon in with Vessey, \\nand the answer is yes. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Do you have any response to The Wall Street Journal \\nreport this morning the President\\'s distressed about some of his \\npress clippings and that perhaps he\\'s distressed with you about that?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.  Well, I do have a response.  I \\nthink the article was highly misleading to the extent that it implied \\nthat the President has had restricted access to the press.  I would \\npoint out that he\\'s answered 358 questions on 77 occasions, more than \\nany of his predecessors. I would also point out it also --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  How many questions?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Three hundred fifty-eight, on 77 \\noccasions.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  How many were while he was jogging?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, no, that\\'s actually a very \\ngood question, Andrea.  And I would point out further that the \\narticle also implied that these questions were only answered at \\ntightly controlled photo opportunities, which is just patently false.  \\nHe\\'s had 13 press conferences in either the East Room, the Oval \\nOffice or the Roosevelt Room or the Briefing Room, in addition to \\nquestions taken at photo opportunities, and that is only the --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Oval Office press conference -- when was that? \\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He\\'s answered questions in the --\\nEast Room.  He\\'s had five in the East Room, he\\'s had one in the Oval \\nOffice, he\\'s had one in the Rose Garden, he\\'s had one or two in the \\nRoosevelt Room.  And this is just to the White House, Washington \\nPress Corps.  In addition to that, he\\'s had 17 interviews with local \\ntelevision anchors.  He\\'s met with the editorial board of The \\nPortland Oregonian.  He\\'s had an hour-long interview with Dan Rather. \\nHe\\'s had interviews with local press from California, Florida and \\nConnecticut --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Can you address the question of the attitude?  The \\narticle implies that he doesn\\'t --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Why doesn\\'t he like us?  (Laughter.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Did you really get blamed for that Post story?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  The story is that you -- are you held responsible \\nfor it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t think I\\'m going to comment \\nabout this.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Are you denying that the President has shown \\ndispleasure publicly?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I am not commenting on the \\ndiscussions between the President and myself.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Did the President write that letter to Chris \\nWebber?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  What?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  The letter to the University of Michigan basketball \\nplayer?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Oh, yes.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  That is an authentic letter?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Since the President first talked about the VAT in \\nFebruary, he said at the time that he thought there probably should \\nbe exceptions made in basic necessities such as food and clothing.  \\nDoes he still hold that position given the impact it could have?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I just can\\'t comment on a \\nproposal he hasn\\'t made.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, does the President have some agenda for \\nthis meeting with the gay leaders tomorrow?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I think it will just a \\ngeneral meeting on the wide range of issues that they care about \\nincluding AIDS and other issues -- civil rights.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  The military issue?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I\\'m certain it will come up.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is he using this event to name the AIDS --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t think so.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, what specifically is the President doing to \\nprepare for tomorrow\\'s meeting with the Prime Minister Miyazawa?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He\\'s had briefing memos.  He\\'s had \\ngeneral discussions with members of the Treasury Department, the \\nTrade Representative and others.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     report yet?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t know if he has the report \\nreferred to in The Times, but Ambassador Kantor was here to brief him \\ntoday.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  He was?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Does he intend to use any of these instances that \\n--\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I don\\'t know that the \\nreport\\'s been presented.  But obviously, the President will press \\nhard in any case where he thinks that a violation has occurred.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  In terms of the Wall Street Journal, the thrust was \\nthat there\\'s a real schism here -- a hostility.  Do you think he \\nfeels that way?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not at all.  As I said on the \\nrecord in the article, I think the President likes reporters.  Again, \\nI think that the thrust of the article was still misleading.  The \\nthrust of the article was that in some way, some attitude which the \\nPresident may or may not have is affecting access when, in fact, he \\nhas the most open, accessible administration than have any in recent \\nhistory.\\n\\n\\t     Q\\t  Can we come up to your office?  (Laughter.)\\n\\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  If you\\'re invited.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESS:  Thank you.\\n\\n                                 END                    1:34 P.M.

In fact, by adjusting the fold of the screen\\nand the monitor configuration, you could have regular OR \"full\" height. \\nThe screen would probably be monochrome.\\nThe motivation behind this is that laptop computers seem to be very\\npopular among business people.  Business people also commonly use word\\nprocessing and spreadsheet applications for which it is very convenient\\nto see a large portion of the document.  Because of the target users and\\napplications, color screens aren\\'t really a neccessity.

In fact, however,\\n# #the argument is specious, at best.  More recent scholarship from the \\n# #last 20-30 years demonstrates rather conclusively that the cotton/sugar/\\n# #tobacco economy and its reliance on slavery was increasingly dominant in \\n# #the South prior to the Civil War.\\n# \\n# This is because the South did not receive the massive momentum of capital\\n#  intensive growth that the Northern states did. Compare the Northern\\n#  agricultural system with the Southern and you will see a major difference \\n#  in the capital to labor intensity.\\n\\nCapital and labor are one and the same in a slave economy.  Except that\\ncapital doesn\\'t reproduce quite as readily as slaves did.\\n\\nSlavery was a dying institution before the cotton gin, yes, but not\\nin 1850.\\n\\n# #It is true that cotton suffered from price depression in the 1840\\'s -\\n# #the period used to claim that slavery would not have lasted in the \\n# #South.  \\n# \\n# That is not the argument that I have heard. It would not have lasted because\\n#  the growth in the North would not have been sustained for much longer without\\n#  spilling over to the Southern states, i.e. Northern industry would have \\n#  migrated capital to the Southern states, and with that would have come \\n#  immigrant labor to the ports of the South, e.g. Charleston, Savannah, Mobile,\\n#  New Orleans, etc. This would have put the breaks on the slave market and\\n#  slavery would have been out-moded by the capital intensity of competing \\n#  agriculturalists. Those that insisted on keeping slaves because of their\\n#  \"Cruel Hearts and Hatred for Black People\" would have been driven out of\\n#  business. Simple capital to labor ratio...read Michael Parkin _Microeconomics_\\n#  2nd edition, and any other basic economics book.\\n\\nThis assumes that the slave holder dominance over state governments\\nwould not have caused the passage of laws to keep out capital from the\\nNorth.  Since slave holders were prepared to do almost anything else\\nto destroy free markets in order to maintain slavery, I do not doubt\\nthat they would have passed laws to cripple any serious competitive\\nthreat.  Thomas Sowell\\'s _Market and Minorities_ argues that the\\nmaintenance of slavery, and the costs it imposed on state and local\\ngovernments, discouraged not only capital formation, but also outside\\ncapital investment in the Southern states.\\n\\n# \\tCraig A.

The only disadvantage I see is that it must be done after the\\ntransformation from view coordinates to coordinates to display on the\\nscreen, which means that a little more calculation isneeded beforehand.  My\\nmethod basically figures out whether the points that will appear on the\\nscreen are clockwise or counterclockwise.  When looking at the back of\\nsomething, the points occur in an opposite direction from the front, so\\nmerely by figuring out which way the points go, you can tell whether you are\\nlooking at the back or front of a 2d polygon.

It\\nwould seem strange to suggest that it, to, were the result of gun\\ncontrol laws.\\n\\n       I think if we looked we\\'d find very specific (cultural and\\nenforcement) reasons why the non-gun rate is low as well, and then\\nthat reasons could be applied to the with-gun rates as easily.\\n\\n\\n       Aside from the fact that I find the idea of being punished\\nbecause somebody might steal something from me and go and commit a\\ncrime with it a silly solution, it still doesn\\'t address the\\nquestion of Canada.  (Which is now, by the way, blaming their rising\\ngun-crime rate on the U.S.  Strange that the border used to \"magically\"\\nkeep the guns out, but now isn\\'t.)\\n\\n\\n       The other side of the coin, of course, is that far \"illegal drugs\"\\nare purchases legally or stolen from people who purchase them legally. \\nI\\'ve still not been convinced that guns, a commodity which criminals\\nhave shown their perfectly willing to pay for from illegal sources\\n(stolen either from police, military, or civilian) we wouldn\\'t simply\\nsee South American sources from which drugs come start smuggling guns as\\nwell, since there\\'s a thriving gun manufacturing industry down there.\\n\\n\\n        And as was not pointed out in the study, but in critiques\\nof it, (two seperate articles by James Wright and David Kopel come\\nto mind) it was pointed out that the difference was *also* almost\\nentirely minority related.  That is, the gun crime rate skyrocketed\\nfor poor minorities (Blacks and Hispanics primarily) while when you\\ncompared the white majority they were virutally identical.\\n\\n        The problem with the NEJM study was they compared minority vs.\\nnon-minority percentages but failed to take into account the relative\\nconditions of those minorities.  That there was an eqaul percentage of\\nnomn-whites was about as far as they went.  They failed to take into\\naccount that the non-whites in either city were not living in the\\nsame conditions.\\n\\n        If the situation was entirely based on availability of guns,\\nthen we\\'d expect that the white rates, the two groups which are\\narguably fairly comparative in the two cities, would have a far\\nhigher rate in Seattle.  Yet the majority in Seattle is not only\\nnot significantly higher when the minorities are excluded, but slightly\\nlower.\\n\\n\\n\\n       The point is, of course, that many of the U.S. \"inner-city\"\\nproblems are not mirrored in Canada.  As such  if there is a condition\\nwhich is significantly different in Canada from the U.S., and violent\\ncrime is highly correlated to that area, suggesting that gun control\\nis the source of Canada\\'s low rate is highly questionable.  (As one\\nCanadian pointed out on talk.politics.guns, Canada\\'s major gun control\\nin 1978 did not result in either a reduction or a slowing of an increase\\nin violent crime rates, which have been rising steadily since.  Apparently\\nthey didn\\'t even mirror the U.S.s very large drop of violent crime in\\nthe early eighties.\\n\\n\\n       True only to a certain extent.  Take Washington D.C., where\\ngun control was instituted while it had crime problems true, but that\\ncrime proceeded to explode afterwards.  Similarly for New York.\\n\\n       The question is not simply a point in time where crime was high\\nor low.  Did the gun control significantly and positively impact\\nviolent crime.  Since it\\'s gone up in those areas, often faster than it\\nwas going up before, you can\\'t simply dismiss the high crime rate by\\nsaying gun control was caused by it.  Yes, gun control may be instituted\\nto deal with high crime.  But if the crime is not positively impacted, you\\ncan\\'t continually say that that crime rate was entirely a cause of\\nthat gun control, since much of that crime rate increased after gun control\\nwas implemented, just as happened in Canada.\\n\\n\\n       As would be expected if violent crime was generally independent\\nof gun control.\\n\\n\\n       Would this be the laws which made manufacturers liable for what\\nothers did with their guns, and suddenly the police found nobody would\\nsell to them?',\n  \"\\nHe's a shortstop by training, but he's been at second (mostly) and third\\nthis year for the Expos.\",\n  \"The 3FGx has a maximum horizontal scan rate of 49KHz, so driving it\\nat 60.24KHz to get 1024 x 768 on the Mac is WAY BEYOND the tolerance            The 4FG is spec'ed at 57KHz, so going 60.24KHz is only 5-6% above\\nthe minimally guaranteed figure.\\n\\nI too doubt if the Damark monitor would sync to a Mac at 1024 x 768.

Digital immortality.\\n\\nThe basic idea behind \"digital immortality\" is that computer networks   \\nare here to stay and that anything interesting you deposit on them\\nwill be around near-forever.  The GIFs and JPGs of today will be the\\nartifacts of a digital future.  Perhaps they\\'ll be put in different\\nformats, perhaps only surviving on backup tapes....but they\\'ll be\\nthere...and someone will dig them up.  \\n \\nIf that doesn\\'t interest you... OTIS also offers a forum for critique\\nand exhibition of your works....a virtual art gallery that never closes\\nand exists in an information dimension where your submissions will hang\\nas wallpaper on thousands of glowing monitors.  Suddenly, life is \\nbreathed into your work...and by merit of it\\'s stimulus, it will \\ntravel the globe on pulses of light and electrons.\\n \\nSpectators are welcome also, feel free to browse the gallery and \\nlet the artists know what you think of their efforts.  Keep your own\\ncopies of the images to look at when you\\'ve got the gumption...\\nthat\\'s what they\\'re here for.\\n\\n---------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nWHERE?             \\n\\nOTIS currently (as of 4/21/93) has two FTP sites.  \\n \\n \\t141.214.4.135 (projects/otis), the UWI site\\n\\t\\t\\n\\tsunsite.unc.edu (/pub/multimedia/pictures/OTIS), the SUNsite \\n\\t(you can also GOPHER to this site for OTIS as well)\\n\\nMerely \"anonymous FTP\" to either site on Internet and change to the\\nappropriate directory.  Don\\'t forget to get busy and use the \"bin\"\\ncommand to make sure you\\'re in binary.\\n\\nOTIS has also been spreading to some dial-up BBS systems around North\\nAmerica....the following systems have a substancial supply of\\nOTIStuff...\\n\\tUnderground Cafe (Omaha) (402.339.0179) 2 lines\\n\\tCyberDen (SanFran?) (415.472.5527)  Usenet Waffle-iron\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n \\nHOW DO YOU CONTRIBUTE?\\n              \\nWhat happens is...you draw a pretty picture or take a lovely   \\nphoto, get it scanned into an image file, then either FTP-put\\nit in the CONTRIB/Incoming directory or use UUENCODE to send it to me\\n(email addresses at eof) in email.  After the image is received,\\nit will be put into the correct directory.  Computer originated works\\nare also welcome.\\n\\nOTIS\\' directories house two types of image files, GIF and JPG.  \\nGIF and JPG files require, oddly enough, a GIF or JPG viewer to \\nsee.  These viewers are available for all types of computers at \\nmost large FTP sites around Internet.  JPG viewers are a bit\\ntougher to find.  If you can\\'t find one, but do have a GIF viewer,  \\nyou can obtain a JPG-to-GIF conversion program which will change    \\nJPG files to a standard GIF format. \\n\\nOTIS also accepts animation files.      \\n\\nWhen you submit image files, please send me email at the same time\\nstating information about what you uploaded and whether it is to be\\nused (in publications or other projects) or if it is merely for people\\nto view.  Also, include some biographical information on yourself, we\\'ll\\nbe having info-files on each contributing artist and their works.  You \\ncan also just upload a text-file of info about yourself (instead of \\nemailing).\\n\\nIf you have pictures, but no scanner, there is hope.  Merely send\\ncopies to:\\n\\nThe OTIS Project\\nc/o Ed Stastny\\nPO BX 241113\\nOmaha, NE 68124-1113\\n\\nI will either scan them myself or get them to someone who will  \\nscan them.  Include an ample SASE if you want your stuff back.  \\nAlso include information on each image, preferably a 1-3 line \\ndescription of the image that we can include in the infofile in the\\ndirectory where it\\'s finally put.  If you have preferences as to what\\nthe images are to be named, include those as well.  \\n \\nConversely, if you have a scanner and would like to help out, please\\ncontact me and we\\'ll arrange things.\\n\\nIf you want to submit your works by disk, peachy.  Merely send a 3.5\"\\ndisk to the above address (Omaha) and a SASE if you want your disk back.\\nThis is good for people who don\\'t have direct access to encoders or FTP,\\nbut do have access to a scanner.  We accept disks in either Mac or IBM\\ncompatible format.  If possible, please submit image files as GIF or\\nJPG.  If you can\\'t...we can convert from most formats...we\\'d just rather\\nnot have to.\\n\\nAt senders request, we can also fill disks with as much OTIS as they\\ncan stand.  Even if you don\\'t have stuff to contribute, you can send\\na blank disk and an SASE (or $2.50 for disk, postage and packing) to \\nget a slab-o-OTIS.\\n\\nAs of 04/21/93, we\\'re at about 18 megabytes of files, and growing.  \\nEmail me for current archive size and directory.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDISTRIBUTION?\\n\\nThe images distributed by the OTIS project may be distributed freely   \\non the condition that the original filename is kept and that it is\\nnot altered in any way (save to convert from one image format to\\nanother).  In fact, we encourage files to be distributed to local \\nbulletin boards and such.  If you could, please transport the\\nappropriate text files along with the images.  \\n \\nIt would also be nice if you\\'d send me a note when you did post images\\nfrom OTIS to your local bbs.  I just want to keep track of them so\\nparticipants can have some idea how widespread their stuff is.\\n\\nIt\\'s the purpose of OTIS to get these images spread out as much as\\npossible.  If you have the time, please upload a few to your favorite\\nBBS system....or even just post this \"info-file\" there.  It would be\\nkeen of you.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nUSE?\\n\\nIf you want to use any of the works you find on the OTIS directory,\\nyou\\'ll have to check to see if permission has been granted and the \\nstipulations of the permission (such as free copy of publication, or\\nfull address credit).  You will either find this in the \".rm\" file for    \\nthe image or series of images...or in the \"Artists\" directory under the \\nArtists name.  If permission isn\\'t explicitly given, then you\\'ll have \\nto contact the artist to ask for it.  If no info is available, email\\nme (ed@cwis.unomaha.edu), and I\\'ll get in contact with the artist for \\nyou, or give you their contact information.\\n \\nWhen you DO use permitted work, it\\'s always courteous to let the artist\\nknow about it, perhaps even send them a free copy or some such\\ncompensation for their files.\\n\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nNAMING IMAGES?\\n\\nPlease keep the names of your files in \"dos\" format.  That means, keep\\nthe filename (before .jpg or .gif) to eight characters or less.  The way\\nI usually do it is to use the initials of the artist, plus a three or\\nfour digit \"code\" for the series of images, plus the series number.\\nThus, Leonardo DeVinci\\'s fifth mechanical drawing would be something\\nlike:\\n \\n\\tldmek5.gif     OR    ldmek5.jpg    OR    ldmech5.gif   ETC\\n\\nKeeping the names under 8 characters assures that the filename will\\nremain intact on all systems.  \\n\\n\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------- \\n\\nCREATING IMAGE FILES?\\n\\nWhen creating image files, be sure to at least include your name\\nsomewhere on or below the picture.  This gives people a reference in\\ncase they\\'d like to contact you.  You may also want to include a title,\\naddress or other information you\\'d like people to know.\\n\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nHMMM?!\\n\\nThat\\'s about it for now.

All present Macs support the use of \\n32-bit color through 32-bit color QuickDraw in ROM.  32-bit color QuickDraw \\nallows an almost transparent capability to display and edit X-bit images in Y-\\nbit color and retain ALL the colors of Y-bit color [Where X and Y \\nindependently are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, or 32] regardless of monitor resolution {63 \\ndpi [12\" color] to 94 dpi [PaletteBook]} or monitor type {including \\nautosynchronous VGA, MCGA and SVGA monitors with ranges including 66.7 hz \\nvertically and 35 kHz horizontally and only a hardware video adaptor (MacUser \\nAug 1992: 158-176).  Older machines that supported color {SE/30, II, IIX, and \\nIIcx} had only 8-bit color in ROM and needed a software patch to use 32-bit \\ncolor (MacUser Special 1993:28-29).  \\nTo keep costs down and speed up most Macs have only 8 or 16 bit display \\ncapability built-in, but most of those can be expanded to display 24-bit \\ncolor.    Presently QuickDraw is optimized for 72 dpi display; QuickDraw QX \\nwill change this.\\nIn addition, QuickDraw allows, in Macs with a NuBus slot, more then one \\nmonitor to be used in any combination, from two monitors showing the same \\nthing to multiple monitors acting as one large large monitor with any degree \\nof overlap of the pictures.\\nVRAM: Video RAM.  Standard for present non-PowerBook Mac\\'s handling of \\n built-in video {from a 32-bit color palette}. VRAM provided runs a 8-bit\\n color 640x480 display; expandable to 16-bit color or a 8-bit 832x624 display. \\nSound output:  Standard in all Macs since the 128K.  Stereo sound became \\n standard with the SE/30.\\n\\nIBM:  Even though PCs have ROM BIOS definitions of how the operating system \\ninteracts with the video hardware (Nan Zou), the use of drivers bypassing \\nBIOS, video hareware inconsitancies {see Super VGA below} and nonstanderzation\\nof clone BIOS have left resolution of video display hardware, OS and program \\ninteraction up to the OS and video hardware in question (Faisal Nameer \\nJawdat). In addition, IBM and clone makers never bothered to provide a \\nstandard hardware mechanism for software to determine what display mode is \\nactually present (Matt Healy) nor a standardized screen-drawing toolbox {like \\nMac\\'s QD}. As a result the OS must be very well written to detect some modes, \\nespecially with some third party cards or to use them consitantly {At present \\nthings are so dependent on the interaction of the program, OS, print driver \\nand monitor card that editing 32-bit pictures regardless of color mode, OS, \\nand monitor type/card combination as one can do on the Mac is impossible with \\nan IBM.  For example, one cannot edit a 32-bit color picture done on a OS/2 \\n486 with a SVGA monitor on a 386 with VGA {18-bit color palette} and DOS 5.0 \\nand still have ALL the colors one started out with}.\\nLater IBM machines will have integrated graphics accelerators, faster \\nprocessors, and modular upgradeability and may have built-in sound cards, CD \\nROM, and Ethernet (PC Week 12/14/92).  \\nMDA: Monocrome Display Adapter\\n original character-mapped video mode, no graphics, 80x25 text.\\nCGA: Color Graphics Array\\n 320x200 4 colors or 640x200 b/w, 16 color palette, bad for the eyes.\\nEGA:  Enhanced Graphics Array\\n 640x350 16 colors from 64 color palette [and some lower res]; some versions \\n could run at 256 colors, bearable on the eyes.\\nVGA:  Video Graphics Array*\\n 320x200 at 256 colors, 640x480 at 16 colors, and some others, these two are \\n the most commonly used.

As such, with each manufacturer \\n using their own implementation scheme, SVGA was chaos with people debating\\n as to what is SVGA and what is not.  In an effort to make SVGA more of a \\n standard VESA was established and is used in the newer units, but things\\n are still a mess.  Video is either 512K [~1990] or 1M [today], resolution\\n of 800x600 and 1024x768 at 16 and 256 colors are common, newer ones [since \\n 1990] have the Sierra HiColor RAMDAC, giving 15-bit 32,768 colors at 800x600, \\n some of the very newer ones [~6/92] can do 24 bits per pixel [usually \\n at 640x480].  Speedwise, too much variation, some very slow [Western Digital \\n Paradise based, for example], some very fast [S3 86C911 based, for example], \\n some are so-so [like Tseng ET4000, a very popular chipset].  Some limiting \\n factors overcome by 40MHz VL Bus & 386\\'s linear address mapping were: \\n 8.33 MHz ISA bus, AT architecture where the CPU looks at the card through a \\n 64K \"window\", etc.\\nOther non-SVGA standards: \\n8514/a:\\n IBM\\'s own standard, interlacing graphics accelerator with graphics functions \\n like linedraw, polygon fill, etc. in hardware. Some clone implementations \\n from ATI are the fastest video available today, though some clone models do \\n not have interlacing. \\nTMS34010/34020: high end graphics co-processors, usually &gt;$1000, some\\n do 24-bit, speeds up vector-oriented graphics like CAD.\\nXGA:  eXtended Graphics Array\\n newer and faster than 8514/a, only available for MCA bus-based PS/2s, clones \\n are coming out soon.

Since this is an architecture, its resolution and color depth \\n isn\\'t fixed {IBM implements only 16-bit [65,536] color, while other \\n companies can have 24-bit color through IBM technical licenses}.

Up to 1280x1024 on OS/2.\\n*some monitor types usable by Mac-See Mac section above for specific details.\\n\\nExpansion\\nBoth Mac & IBM\\nSCSI: only external device expansion interface common to both Mac and IBM.\\n Allows the use of any device: hard drive, printer, scanner, Nubus card \\n expansion {Mac Plus only}, some monitors, and CD-ROM.  \\n Main problem:  there are a lot of external devices which are internal \\n terminated which causes problems for more then two devises off the SCSI port \\n {A SCSI chain is supposed to be terminated ONLY at the begining and at the \\n end.  Any other set up causes problems for either Mac or IBM}. \\nSCSI-1:  7 devices per SCSI controller.  8-bit asynchronous {~1.5MB/s ave}\\n and synchronous {5MB/s max} transfers.  Difference is due to SCSI-1 software\\n drivers.  \"Fast SCSI-1\" is a misname for 8-bit SCSI-2 in SCSI-1 mode\\n {see SCSI-2 for details}.\\nSCSI-2: 10 devices per SCSI controller in SCSI-2 mode.  SCSI-2 is fully\\n SCSI-1 compliant and 8-bit SCSI-2 tends to be implemented as a very fast\\n SCSI-1 since it does not require the different controller interfaces in  \\n hardware and software that 16 and 32-bit SCSI-2 do.  Transfer speeds are\\n 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst {8-bit}, 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst {16-bit}, and\\n 15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst {32-bit/wide and fast}.  Since 8-bit SCSI-2 can\\n use SCSI-1 software drivers and hardware at 8-bit SCSI-2 speeds and as such\\n is limited to 7 devices sometimes it is mistakenly called \"fast SCSI-1\". \\n 16-bit fast SCSI-2 requires a SCSI-2 software driver and SCSI-2 electronics\\n but can still use the SCSI-1 ports.  Wide 16-bit and 32-bit SCSI-2 require a\\n different SCSI port, electronics, and software driver from SCSI-1 {Which\\n makes them more expensive than other SCSI interfaces}.\\nMac SCSI: asynchronous SCSI-1 built-in standard since the Plus.  Even though \\n Apple developed some specifications for SCSI controlers, the OS SCSI Manager\\n needs to be rewritten to take full advantage of the features of both SCSI\\n interfaces.  As a result present SCSI-2 Macs use 8-bit SCSI-2 as a fast \\n asynchronous SCSI-1.  Presently Quadras are the only Macs with a SCSI-2\\n controller chip built-in (Digital Review, Oct 21, 1991 v8 n33 p8(1)) \\n though they lack some other parts of the hardware, like the wide SCSI-2 port \\n interface.  Since other Macs require a NuBus card to use SCSI-2, older NuBus \\n Macs had a bottleneck due to the speed of the NuBus and CPU.  Rumor-some\\n Cyclone Macs {June} will come with a wide & fast SCSI-2 port standard \\n and have a rewritten OS SCSI manager.\\nIBM SCSI:  SCSI-1 is not too wide spread yet, generally not bundled with \\n systems, except as add-on {EISA and VESA Local Bus adapters avalable}.\\n Like the Mac, 8-bit SCSI-2 is used as a very fast SCSI-1 by most controllers\\n out there.  Unlike the Mac, IBM has no exact SCSI controller specifications\\n which results in added incompatibilities for SCSI.\\n\\nMac\\nMemory expansion: with a few exceptions the Mac has used non-parity 30-pin \\n 8-bit SIMM memory expansion since the Plus.  While 32-pin 9-bit parity SIMMs\\n could be used in these Macs, only special IIcis could make use of the parity \\n feature {By convension both SIMM types are called 32-pin SIMMs}.  The IIfx \\n used 64-pin parity SIMMs.  The LC III, C610/650 and Q800 all use a new \\n 72-pin SIMM that is accessable by 32-bits at a time and is used in IBMs.\\n The Mac does a complete memory check at startup by writing/reading every\\n memory location; if something is seriously wrong with a SIMM the Mac will\\n not boot and give a sound chord indicating what the problem is.\\n Since Macs made before Feb 15, 1993 managed memory baced on data path, SIMMs \\n had to be installed in pairs {16-bit} or in sets of 4 {32-bit}.  The Centris \\n 650 and Quadra 800 eliminate this with a new memory management setup that \\n allows memory to be upgraded one SIMM at a time.  If the SIMMs are the same \\n size are used then the memory is \\'interleaved\\' across the two SIMMs resulting \\n in a 10-15% performance boost on RAM access (MacWorld Apr 93: 108-109).\\nPrinters, ADBs, and modems: built-in interfaces standard.\\nMonitor interface and sound input: built-in on most present macs. \\nPDS: Available in SE & all present non-Powerbook Macs. 16-bit {SE, \\n Portable, LC, LC II, Classic line} and 32-bit.

Standardized with\\n the LC and 040 bus designs.  With an adapter one NuBus card can be used in \\n IIsi and C610.  Problem: some cards have timing dependency which slows \\n through put down.\\nNuBus Mac II: 32-bit, 10 MHz bus clock, 1-to-1 transaction/bus cycle ratio,\\n and contiguous, hand-shake transactions at ~10-20MB/s; theoretical peak:\\n 40MB/s.  Built-in on all Modular Macs except the LC series, C610, and \\n Performa 400.  The SE/30 could be adapted to use this and there was even a \\n Mac Plus SCSI NuBus.

In addition, \\nwhat little ROM code there is also read into RAM {a process called Shadow ROM}  \\nThis results in faster implementation since RAM is faster then PROMS or \\nEPROMS.  Having most of the OS code on disk has the advantage of being able to \\nbetter optimize the code given a certain piece or collection of hardware which \\nis harder with a ROM based system due to the \\'patches\\' needed.  In addition it \\nreduces the need for and size of patches if a major revision of the hardware \\nsupport is needed.\\nSide note:  The FTC charged that MicroSoft formed a OS trust by not providing \\nall feature documentation for its OSes to developers outside MS and designing \\nits Windows and DOS apps to fail under OS/2 (\"Undocumented Windows\") and \\n\"There is deliberate code in [Windows] NT Beta which causes the install to \\nabort if OS/2 Boot Manager is present\" (Gregory Hicks, Info-IBMPC Digest V92 \\n#201).

Floating point numbers are 96 bits long when an \\nFPU is present and 80 bits otherwise. Exceptions, such as dividing by zero or \\ntaking the square root of a negative number, do not cause an abort but are \\nhandled in a logically consistent manner. 1/0 produces the internal \\nrepresentation for infinity (INF).  1/(1/0) produces zero. The above treatment \\nof 1/(1/0) occurs in an FPU-equipped machine even when SANE is bypassed and \\nthe FPU programmed directly.\\n\\nIBM\\n Floating point numbers are 80-bits with a hardware FPU, 64-bits when \\nemulated.  The way they are handled is dependent on the coding of whatever \\ncompiler or assembler was used for a program. On older DOS complilers \\nexceptions could cause program aborts; 1/0 and 1/(1/0) would abort to the DOS \\nprompt at the point where they occured.  Most present compilers handle this \\nbetter.  Result: there is little consistent handling of numbers between DOS, \\nWindows and OS/2 programs nor between programs for just one OS.\\n\\nNetworking [Includes printing]\\nWYSIWYG printing can be a problem with either Mac of IBM machines especially \\nif one sends TrueType fonts to a older style PostScript printer.\\nMac\\nHardware: Built-in LocalTalk network port and a built-in printer port.  \\nLocalTalk has moderate speeds (230.4 Kb/s) requires special connectors for \\neach machine ($15 and up) and can be run off of either the printer port {to \\ninclude very old macs} or the network port {standard today}.  Built-in \\nEthernet is becoming common but many older Macs require a PDS or Nubus card at \\nabout $150-$300 for each machine.  These cards provide three connectors and \\ntransceivers {thick, thin, and 10BaseT} for Ethernet.\\nThe Macintosh Quadra family and some Centris models includes Ethernet \\ninterface on motherboard, with transceivers available. TokenRing has been a \\nnetwork option since 1989.\\nSoftware: AppleTalk {the suite of protocols} standard with Mac OS, which can \\nuse variety of media types.  AppleShare client software included with the OS \\nas well and can connect to file servers such as Novell Netware, 3Com 3+Open, \\nBanyan Vines, DEC Pathworks, Apple\\'s AppleShare servers, System 7 File Sharing \\nmachines, and AFP servers running on variety of UNIX hosts.  MacTCP allows \\ntypical TCP/IP communications (telnet, ftp, NFS, rlogin).  A later version \\nwill have Unix X/Open Transport Interface (XTI) built-in by the end of 1993 \\n(MacWeek 04/12/93).  Third-party software to connect to NFS servers.  DEC \\nPathworks provides DECnet support.  Peer-to-peer file sharing software \\nbuilt-in to System 7.1 (See OS section).  Full server software is extra. \\nPrinting requires connection of the printer and the printer being selected in \\nthe chooser.  Changing printers is by selecting a different name in the \\nchooser.  The same is true of connecting to servers.\\nPrinting bugs:  Monaco TrueType font is different then the screen bitmap font.\\n {QuickDraw QX is suppossed to fix this and similar problems.}\\n\\nIBM  \\nHardware: LocalTalk [not widely used], Ethernet,  and TokenRing.\\nSoftware: Novell Netware, Banyan Vines, DECNet, Windows/Work Groups, AppleTalk \\nprotocols, and AppleShare {subset of AppleTalk}.\\nEach of the MS-DOS networking schemes are, in general, totally incompatible \\nwith the others. Once you have chosen one, you are pretty much locked-in to \\nthat product line from then on.  Windows/Work Groups is a little more \\nforgiving and removes some of this problem.  Novell Netware is the biggest, \\n{~80 percent of the corporate market.} and in general is more powerful and \\noffers better control/management/security than AppleShare, but it\\'s also more \\ncomplex to set up and manage.  This will change due to the use of the Mac \\nfinder and file management system by Novell.

Network Printing is not controlled by the system, but is mostly \\n implemented by the actual program, therefore performance varies from one \\n software program to the next.\\nWindows 3.x: supports standard drivers and can do a good job of showing \"jobs\" \\n in the print queue, but it always lists printers as \"active\"... even if they \\n are not.  This becomes a problem if there are several incompatible printers \\n on the same net, because there\\'s no way for software to reliably determine \\n which printer is active right now.  Windows for Workgroups is more Mac-like \\n and intelligent about this.\\nOS/2: Mac-like; the os deals with printers, with apps making calls to the OS.\\nPrinting bugs: due to poor programing some programs for all the above OSes do \\nnot have WYSIWYG printing.

Congressional\\nRepublicans, in an effort to discredit the stimulus package, selected what\\nthey felt were silly sounding projects from a wish-list of POTENTIAL \\nprojects prepared by the US Mayors\\' Conference before the stimulus package\\nwas ever proposed.  (The document in question was designed to pressure the\\nWhite House to increase the size of the block grant proposal submitted\\nto Congress.  It didn\\'t work.)\\n\\nThe $2.56(?) billion proposed in the stimulus package came nowhere close\\nto covering the total estimated cost of the original wish-list.  If it\\nwere passed, communities would have to select which projects to fund and\\nat what level.\\n\\nIn the case of Spokane, Wa., Tom Foley\\'s home district, no one ever\\nexpected to be able to refurbish a local swimming pool (one of the \\nRepublicans\\' examples) FROM THE FUNDS AVAILABLE IN THE STIMULUS\\nPACKAGE since the estimated cost of doing so exceeded the total \\namount of block grant funds the city would receive from the stimulus \\npackage for ALL projects.  \\n\\nThe plan, instead, was to use the money on public housing construction\\nand remodeling to cope with a severe housing shortage.  (Yup, there are\\nplaces where that is true.)  The swimming pool improvements were near the\\nbottom of a long list of priorities prepared by the city.  The $3 million\\nor so to be received would cover only a few of the most pressing\\npriorities.\\n\\nIf the block grants are cut from the stimulus package, it is these projects\\nthat will be affected by the lack of funds.  And that is why the Clinton\\nadministration has been publicizing the issue.\\n\\nA final point.  One may or may not like community block grants.  It is\\nworth noting, however, that Congressional Republicans\\' opposition to them\\nis new.  Since the Nixon administration, Republicans have generally \\nsupported such grants as an alternative to targeted federal spending,\\narguing that local governments are far better able to determine spending\\npriorities than \"Washington bureaucrats.\"  \\n\\nIs it clear now?

It\\'s not a definite,\\nhard-and-fast function, but there is definitely a correlation. In fact, as a\\nrule of thumb, if teams A and B both score X runs and team A allows Y runs,\\nfor every 10 runs fewer than Y that team B allows, it will win another game.\\nSo, for instance, if we look at the 1991 Toronto Blue Jays, we find that\\nthey scored 780 runs and allowed 682, of which Morris allowed 114. All other\\nthings being equal, if Frank Viola, with his 3.44 ERA had replaced Jack\\nMorris for the 240.2 innings Morris threw (plausible, since Viola threw 238\\nfor Boston), the \"Red Jays\" would have allowed about 15 fewer runs, or\\nenough for 1-2 more wins. Now, that doesn\\'t take into account that Viola\\npitched half his innings in Fenway, which is a harder park to pitch in\\n(particularly for a lefthander) than Skydome. So, um, Roger. Unless you\\nreally do believe that a pitcher can somehow affect the number of runs\\nhis team scores, could you enlighten us to the fallacy in this\\nanalysis? Clearly, it would be foolhardy to claim that Viola would\\nnecessarily have put up a 3.44 if he had been on the Jay last year, but\\nthat is not the claim.

Is the offset of an ellipse still\\nan ellipse? The answer is no! Ironically, DMIS - an American Indutrial\\nStandard says it is ellipse.

In the\\nGerman Weimar system, the Chancellor was not necessarily the leader of the\\nlargest Reichstag party; the Chancellor was appointed by the President and\\ngenerally was the leader of a coalition of parties who could form an effective\\nmajority in the Reichstag. Beyond that, the implication that Hitler rose to\\nthe Chancellorship because a majority of Germans wanted Nazi rule is false\\nas well. Before President Hindenburg appointed Hitler Chancellor in January\\n1933, the German people did not show a particular desire to be led either by\\nHitler or by the Nazi party. These are the results of the March 1932 election\\nfor President, the closest Hitler ever came to direct election: Hindenburg\\n49.6%, Hitler 30.1%, Thaelmann 13.2%, Duesterberg 6.8%. In the runoff election\\nin April the results were: Hindenburg 53%, Hitler 36.8%, Thaelmann 10.2%.\\nSo we can see that Hitler personally was supported by only about a third of\\nGerman voters.\\n\\nSimilarly, the Nazi party never received more than 37% of the vote in\\nReichstag elections. That occurred in July 1932. In the November 1932 election\\nthe Nazis *lost* two million votes and 34 seats, down from 230 to 196 out of\\nthe 608 in the Reichstag. Comparitively, the Socialists had 121 and the\\nCommunists 100. The Communists had gained 11 seats, and the German National\\nparty, which had supported the previous government, had picked up a million\\nof the Nazis' lost votes to gain 15 seats (up to 52). I think the other large\\nparty was the Catholic Center party (I don't know how many seats they had but\\nI think they were declining), and there were numerous other small parties.\\nThus the Nazi vote was on the decline at the time Hitler was appointed\\nChancellor.\\n\\nWhat brought Hitler to power was *not* the demand of the German people for\\nHitler or the Nazis to run things, but the inability of the other parties to\\nput their differences behind them in favor of forming an effective government\\nfor the country. Germany did not have an enduring democratic tradition, and\\ntheir parliamentary system lacked effective center parties that favored the\\ninterests of the majority of the population. Instead what they had was a\\nnumber of small parties who were unable to put aside their own specific\\nobjectives in order to combine against the Nazis, who were out to end the\\ndemocratic process. In fact, part of the problem was that some of the other\\nparties with substantial representation, like the Communists, were also\\nout to end the democratic process, but with different results in mind, and\\ngenerally didn't mind seeing parliamentary democracy go under.\\n\\nGermany had already had a non-Nazi Chancellor with a majority coalition\\nfor five months while the Nazis had been the largest Reichstag party, and\\nthere certainly was no danger of a revolution in favor of the Nazis.\\nIf anything the Nazis were starting to get desperate because they had failed\\nto get enough support to make Hitler President and their popular vote had\\nbegun to decline.\\n\\nHitler was not Hindenburg's first choice to be Chancellor, not even his\\nsecond choice. First, von Papen had been Chancellor since June 1932. After\\nthe November election when the Nazis *lost* seats, Hindenburg first prevailed\\non von Papen to remain as Chancellor. But there were intrigues behind his back\\nand support for him was lacking. So then Hindenburg turned to von Schleicher,\\nwho became Chancellor for two months. Eventually he too was unable to hold\\ntogether a working coalition of parties to oppose the Nazis, who refused to\\nparticipate in any government that was not led by a Nazi Chancellor. Some of\\nthe Nazi leadership, particularly Gregor Strasser who was the #2 man in the\\nparty at the time, wanted to participate in a coalition government. But others,\\nknowing the party's support was waning, figured that their best hope to gain\\npower lay in undermining the democratic process. Nevertheless, the country\\nwas governed for seven months by Chancellors who were not Nazis, even though\\nthe Nazis were the largest Reichstag party. The failure of these men to\\nachieve a working coalition was due to the inability of their coalition\\nparties to work together.\\n\\nHere's how William Shirer puts it in _The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich_:\\n\\n   The cardinal error of the Germans who opposed Nazism was their\\n   failure to unite against it. At the crest of their popular strength,\\n   in July 1932, the National Socialists had attained but 37 percent of\\n   the vote. But the 63 percent of the German people who expressed their\\n   opposition to Hitler were much too divided and shortsighted to combine\\n   against a common danger which they must have known would overwhelm\\n   them unless they united, however temporarily, to stamp it out.\\n\\nTrue, the German people supported Hitler after he became Chancellor.

In better EC countries that use pure (but public) health\\ninsurance (like we use in Canada) rather than self-enclosed HMO-like\\nsocialized medicine, 30% of our costs comes from private supplementary\\ninsurance and/or copayments.  France Magazine\\'s Summer 1992 edition\\nhas a fantastic presentation of their basic insurance coverage,\\nincluding a sample chart of copayment percentages.  For 1-30 days,\\nyou\\'re covered for 80% of the public hospital rate, 100% afterward.\\nWith extra private insurance, you can get into a private hospital and\\nbe covered for any differences beyond the public hospital rate.  The\\npublic insurance covers 100% beyond 30 days, or the same cash amount\\nfor a private hospital and the difference is paid out-of-pocket or\\naccording to your supplementary private insurance.  Over 2/3rds of\\nFrench have some form of extra private insurance.  So, 30% of health\\ncosts in Europe are out of private funds and not gleaned from other\\ntaxes.  The GDP figures are combined public and private expenditures\\nfor total outlay using the same methods that yield the 13-14% figure\\nfor the U.S.\\n\\nThat the French had deductibles and copayments in their insurance fund\\nis to their credit ... I am in the minority for advocating such back\\nin Canada (to make the Canadian insurance look more like real health\\ninsurance -- which actually it is).  The new Reform Party, a breakoff\\nof traditionalists from the Conservatives with a mildly \"libertarian\"\\nfaction, hold our public health insurance as an untouchable but that\\njust a few people have to be reminded that it\\'s not free (the average\\nCanadian/European is more fiscally naive than their American\\ncounterparts on issues like these).\\n\\nI\\'m one of the few people who favour copayments (forget about\\nleftists, even our conservatives attack me for it on the Canadian\\nnewsgroups) to make it look more like real insurance, \\'cos the 100%\\ninsurance payment is hidden (unlike in France) and if you didn\\'t know\\nit, you\\'d believe it actually is socialized medicine (American\\nconservatives/libertarians and Canadian leftists are the only ones who\\nseriously call it that).  Canadians aren\\'t worried about the\\nAmericans, who spend 14%; we\\'re worried about the French and Germans\\nwho spend 7% to our 9% ... so the insurance is looking at things that\\nshouldn\\'t be paid for out of general funds like physicals for\\ninsurance policies, sick notes, electrolysis, etc.  The reason that\\nthe Canadian health insurance hasn\\'t spiralled out of control despite\\nbeing open and universal is that unlike Americans, there is no urge to\\nspend all of your benefits\\' worth, and more if you can ... we\\'re a\\ndifferent culture.\\n\\n\\n\"Managed Care\" relies on HMO\\'s, which are unknown in most western\\nnations that use only public health insurance like Canada, France\\nand Germany (I\\'m Canadian, and my German father-in-law-to-be says\\nof HMO/NHS approaches, \"We left that behind with East Germany!\").\\nSure, HMO/NHS controls costs because you have managers strangling\\ndoctors with budget strings.\\n\\nIn Canada, we use the public health insurance approach as in France\\nand Germany, with all private doctors and both private and public\\nhospitals.  It is all pure insurance without HMO\\'s.  The divisions\\nare different, with the Germans using a couple hundred interlinked\\n\"sickness funds\" over a century old while Canada divides by their\\nprovinces (who run the insurance fund and set local fees with the\\ndoctors monopoly; federal funds cover the fees disbursed.)\\n\\nWith such an open-ended system, it\\'s no surprise that Canada is #2 to\\nthe U.S. in costs; all-insurance is the most expensive way to go. The\\nFrench and Germans use the same approach but have larger populations\\nin more compact geography to improve scales of economy.\\n\\ngld',\n  \"\\n\\nHi, I've come across a fast triangle fill-draw routine for mode 13h.

So here it comes:\\n\\nCView has quite a number of bugs.  The one you mention is perhaps the most\\nannoying, but not the most dangerous.  As far as I can determine, it has to\\ndo with the temp files that CView creates.  CView gives the user no control\\nover where it places its temp files: it just places them in its\\n\"current directory\".  The problem you mention occurs (as far as I can tell)\\nwhen it runs out of disk space for its temp files. It seems as if CView\\ndoesn\\'t check properly for this situation.  As Cview decodes a jpeg, it seems \\nto write out a temp file with all the pixel data with 24 bit colour\\ninformation. Then, for 8 bit displays, it does the \"dithering\", again writing\\nanother file with the 8 bit colour information.  While it is writing this\\nsecond file, it also writes the data to your colour card. Then when it does\\nthe last chunk of 8 bit data, it recopies all the data from the 8 bit file to\\nyour screen again.  (It does this last \"recopy\" operation for its\\n\"fit to screen\" feature, even when this feature is not enabled.)\\n\\n The result of this process is the following:\\n  \\n     1) If it runs out of disk space when writing the first 24 bit file, all\\n        you ever see is as much data as it has room for, and the last bit of\\n        data is simply repeated over and over again because CView never\\n        realizes the disk has filled up and disk writes/reads aren\\'t performed.\\n\\n     2) If it has enough room for the 24 bit data, but runs out of room for\\n        the 8 bit data, you see almost all of the picture as it does the\\n        dithering and writes to the screen card.\\n        However, then when it finishes the dithering and recopies the data\\n        from the 8 bit file to screen (for whatever reason it does this)\\n        one again just gets a repetition of the last chunk of data for which\\n        there was room on the disk.\\n\\nThis is just a guess, but probably fairly accurate.  At least the general\\nidea is on track I think, although I have probably made errors in details\\nabout file I/O etc.  The way around this is  of course to clear up sufficient\\ndisk space.  The temp files for large JPEG\\'s (1200x900 and bigger) can be\\nvery large (3 Meg + 1 Meg ).  On some of the largest I have needed in excess\\nof 6 Meg free disk space.\\n\\n\\nCView has a much more serious bug: if you are trying to display a file from\\na floppy, and you change floppies while CView has some temp file open on the\\nfloppy, then CView in certain circumstances will write the directory (and FAT\\ntable? I can\\'t remember) for the removed floppy onto the newly inserted\\nfloppy, thus corruptimg the new floppy in a very serious, possibly\\nunrevcoverable way.  SO BE CAREFUL!  It is incredibly poor programming for a\\nprogram to do this.  On the other hand, when choosing files in the Open Files\\nmenu, CView insists on doing a few disk reads every time one moves the\\nhi-lighter square.  Incredibly annoying when it could do them all at once\\nwhen it gets the directory info.  And really, how much effort does it take to\\nsort a directory listing?\\n',\n  \"Hi,\\n\\n\\tI have a problem, I hope some of the 'gurus' can help me solve.\\n\\n\\tBackground of the problem:\\n\\tI have a rectangular mesh in the uv domain, i.e  the mesh is a \\n\\tmapping of a 3d Bezier patch into 2d.

The \\ncopier/printer has both a parallel and SCSI interface.  I have configured the\\nprinter with the \"lp\" system using the parallel interface and can print \\npostscript files to the printer.  I can also print rgb files, but these are in \\nturn converted to postscript by an internal filter.  The Canon CLC 500 is a \\npublication quality printer but the quality of our postscript printouts \\nare less than acceptable.  We create the postscript files with a variaty of \\nprograms, such as showcase, xv, and tops.  When we convert to postscript \\nwith tops and use the -l option to specify the halftone screen density of 98 \\nrather than the default 40 the output is better, but still much less that \\nacceptable.  Note, that we are starting with a screen image in rgb image format\\nand translating the image into postscript.\\n\\nWe suspect that if we could use the SCSI interface we would get higher quality \\npictures.  We have not purchased the software that drives the printer from the \\nSCSI port.  To my knowledge this software is $5000 and does not come with a \\nwarranty.  The management here does not want to spend this much money without \\nsome assurance that the product will work.\\n\\n\\nHere my questions:\\n\\nIf anybody on the net uses this printer are you using the SCSI or \\nparallel port?

Labor is defined, economically, as the efforts,\\n# # both mental and physical, of humans. Capital is defined as intermediate\\n# # goods used to create other goods and services.

The question of defining slave \"labor\" is no \"tough(er)\" than \\n# defining the \"labor\" of a horse, an ox, or any other livestock.

EDT\\n             \\n             \\n             THE PRESIDENT:  Good morning.  My voice is coming to\\nyou this morning through the facilities of the oldest radio\\nstation in America, KDKA in Pittsburgh.  I'm visiting the city to\\nmeet personally with citizens here to discuss my plans for jobs,\\nhealth care and the economy.  But I wanted first to do my weekly\\nbroadcast with the American people. \\n             \\n             I'm told this station first broadcast in 1920 when\\nit reported that year's presidential elections.  Over the past\\nseven decades presidents have found ways to keep in touch with\\nthe people, from whistle-stop tours to fire-side chats to the bus\\ntour that I adopted, along with Vice President Gore, in last\\nyear's campaign.\\n             \\n             Every Saturday morning I take this time to talk with\\nyou, my fellow Americans, about the problems on your minds and\\nwhat I'm doing to try and solve them.  It's my way of reporting\\nto you and of giving you a way to hold me accountable.\\n             \\n             You sent me to Washington to get our government and\\neconomy moving after years of paralysis and policy and a bad\\nexperiment with trickle-down economics.  You know how important\\nit is for us to make bold, comprehensive changes in the way we do\\nbusiness.  \\n             \\n             We live in a competitive global economy.  Nations\\nrise and fall on the skills of their workers, the competitiveness\\nof their companies, the imagination of their industries, and the\\ncooperative experience and spirit that exists between business,\\nlabor and government.  Although many of the economies of the\\nindustrialized world are now suffering from slow growth, they've\\nmade many of the smart investments and the tough choices which\\nour government has for too long ignored.  That's why many of them\\nhave been moving ahead and too many of our people have been\\nfalling behind.\\n             \\n             We have an economy today that even when it grows is\\nnot producing new jobs.  We've increased the debt of our nation\\nby four times over the last 12 years, and we don't have much to\\nshow for it.  We know that wages of most working people have\\nstopped rising, that most people are working longer work weeks\\nand that too many families can no longer afford the escalating\\ncost of health care.\\n             \\n             But we also know that, given the right tools, the\\nright incentives and the right encouragement, our workers and\\nbusinesses can make the kinds of products and profits our economy\\nneeds to expand opportunity and to make our communities better\\nplaces to live.\\n             \\n             In many critical products today Americans are the\\nlow cost, high quality producers.  Our task is to make sure that\\nwe create more of those kinds of jobs.\\n             \\n             Just two months ago I gave Congress my plan for\\nlong-term jobs and economic growth.  It changes the old\\npriorities in Washington and puts our emphasis where it needs to\\nbe -- on people's real needs, on increasing investments and jobs\\nand education, on cutting the federal deficit, on stopping the\\nwaste which pays no dividends, and redirecting our precious\\nresources toward investment that creates jobs now and lays the\\ngroundwork for robust economic growth in the future.\\n             \\n             These new directions passed the Congress in record\\ntime and created a new sense of hope and opportunity in our\\ncountry.  Then the jobs plan I presented to Congress, which would\\ncreate hundreds of thousands of jobs, most of them in the private\\nsector in 1993 and 1994, passed the House of Representatives.  It\\nnow has the support of a majority of the United States Senate. \\nBut it's been held up by a filibuster of a minority in the\\nSenate, just 43 senators.  They blocked a vote that they know\\nwould result in the passage of our bill and the creation of jobs.\\n             \\n             The issue isn't politics; the issue is people. \\nMillions of Americans are waiting for this legislation and\\ncounting on it, counting on us in Washington.  But the jobs bill\\nhas been grounded by gridlock.  \\n             \\n             I know the American people are tired of business as\\nusual and politics as usual.  I know they don't want us to spin\\nor wheels.  They want the recovery to get moving.  So I have\\ntaken a first step to break this gridlock and gone the extra\\nmile.  Yesterday I offered to cut the size of this plan by 25\\npercent -- from $16 billion to $12 billion.  \\n             \\n             It's not what I'd hoped for.  With 16 million\\nAmericans looking for full-time work, I simply can't let the bill\\nlanguish when I know that even a compromise bill will mean\\nhundreds of thousands of jobs for our people.  The mandate is to\\nact to achieve change and move the country forward.  By taking\\nthis initiative in the face of an unrelenting Senate talkathon, I\\nthink we can respond to your mandate and achieve a significant\\nportion of our original goals.\\n             \\n             First, we want to keep the programs as much as\\npossible that are needed to generate jobs and meet human needs,\\nincluding highway and road construction, summer jobs for young\\npeople, immunization for children, construction of waste water\\nsites, and aid to small businesses.  We also want to keep funding\\nfor extended unemployment compensation benefits, for people who\\nhave been unemployed for a long time because the economy isn't\\ncreating jobs.\\n             \\n             Second, I've recommended that all the other programs\\nin the bill be cut across-the-board by a little more than 40\\npercent.\\n             \\n             And third, I've recommended a new element in this\\nprogram to help us immediately start our attempt to fight against\\ncrime by providing $200 million for cities and towns to rehire\\npolice officers who lost their jobs during the recession and put\\nthem back to work protecting our people.  I'm also going to fight\\nfor a tough crime bill because the people of this country need it\\nand deserve it.\\n             \\n             Now, the people who are filibustering this bill --\\nthe Republican senators -- say they won't vote for it because it\\nincreases deficit spending, because there's extra spending this\\nyear that hasn't already been approved.  That sounds reasonable,\\ndoesn't it?  Here's what they don't say.  This program is more\\nthan paid for by budget cuts over my five-year budget, and this\\nbudget is well within the spending limits already approved by the\\nCongress this year.\\n             \\n             It's amazing to me that many of these same senators\\nwho are filibustering the bill voted during the previous\\nadministration for billions of dollars of the same kind of\\nemergency spending, and much of it was not designed to put the\\nAmerican people to work.  \\n             \\n             This is not about deficit spending.  We have offered\\na plan to cut the deficit.  This is about where your priorities\\nare -- on people or on politics.  \\n             \\n             Keep in mind that our jobs bill is paid for dollar\\nfor dollar.  It is paid for by budget cuts.  And it's the\\nsoundest investment we can now make for ourselves and our\\nchildren.  I urge all Americans to take another look at this jobs\\nand investment program; to consider again the benefits for all of\\nus when we've helped make more American partners working to\\nensure the future of our nation and the strength of our economy.\\n             \\n             You know, if every American who wanted a job had\\none, we wouldn't have a lot of the other problems we have in this\\ncountry today.  This bill is not a miracle, it's a modest first\\nstep to try to set off a job creation explosion in this country\\nagain.  But it's a step we ought to take.  And it is fully paid\\nfor over the life of our budget.\\n             \\n             Tell your lawmakers what you think.  Tell them how\\nimportant the bill is.  If it passes, we'll all be winners.\\n             \\n             Good morning, and thank you for listening.\",\n  \"Hi,\\n\\nI'm interested in writing a program to generate a SIRD picture, you know\\nthe stereogram where you cross your eyes and the picture becomes 3D.\\n\\nDoes anyone have one or know where I can get one?\\n\\nPlease e-mail to steveq@sndcrft.DIALix.oz.au with any replies.\\n\\nMany thanks for your help.\",\n  \"\\nAnd who's advocating that?

However, this does not refute debunking\\nof waiting lines for urgent AND routine care, as has been done in the\\nU.S. by Consumers Reports, health policy studies cited by Prof. Dennis\\nE. Shea on USENET, CNN, NYT, etc.\\n\\nDoug Fierro has posted a NYT article from 3 weeks ago about Canada\\'s\\nhealth insurance approach, on Talk.politics.medicine.  There is one\\nsmall error in the article: not all of our hospitals are private.\\n\\n\\nOf course, the one thing to note is that in the Canada/France/Germany\\ncase, private insurance *offloaded* the basic coverage to the public\\nsector.  They realized they were keeping low-risk/high-profit extra\\ninsurance for things like private/semi-private rooms (vs. ward\\naccomodation), dental, glasses, etc. for corporate or personal\\nbenefits, they\\'ll have nothing to do with you if you want to be\\ncovered for basic care.\\n\\nAt that point, they wouldn\\'t even consider a \"voucher\" approach\\nto broker the universal coverage and sell policies to make up\\nthe difference in the federal guidelines and market stuff.\\n\\n\\nIt is \"free\" in that there are no deductibles nor copayments (two\\nthings which I advocate to make the Canadian insurance look more like\\nreal health insurance -- which actually it is).  I know that when\\nworking in Alberta, Ontario and Quebec, I was aware that I was paying\\nfor health insurance - e.g., in Toronto, OHIP fees were listed on my\\npay stub; Manitoba did not collect at paycheque time, but only\\nannually at income tax time (built into the tax rate).  Only fiscal\\nnaifs will proclaim that it\\'s free, along with the Canadian Left for\\nthat is part of their brainwashing agenda.\\n\\nThe French do have copayments, though.  France Magazine\\'s Summer \\n1992 edition has a fantastic presentation of their basic insurance\\ncoverage, including a sample chart of copayment percentages.  For \\n1-30 days, you\\'re covered for 80% of the public hospital rate, 100%\\nafterward.  With extra private insurance, you can get into a private\\nhospital and be covered for any differences beyond the public hospital\\nrate.  The public insurance covers 100% beyond 30 days, or the same\\ncash amount for a private hospital and the difference is paid\\nout-of-pocket or according to your supplementary private insurance.\\nOver 2/3rds of French have some form of extra private insurance.  So,\\nthe other 30% of health costs in Europe are out of private funds, not\\ngleaned from other taxes.  The GDP figures are combined public and\\nprivate expenditures for total outlay using the same methods that\\nyield the 13-14% figure for the U.S.\\n\\n\\nHealth insurance does exist in Canada and in Western Europe, its\\njust that it doesn\\'t cover basic care.  You can opt out in Canada\\nand Germany, but you\\'ll have to go uninsured as a result because\\nthere are too few other people that do so --- i.e., no market.\\n\\nWhen private insurance realized how much money they\\'d make without the\\nrisks involved in basic insurance (e.g., neurosurgery) versus deluxe\\namenities (e.g., having to call Granada TV to replace a rental set on\\nthe fritz in someone\\'s private hospital room), they started to pat\\nthemselves on the back for their social responsibility.  In Quebec\\nlast spring, a consortium of private insurers publicly warned against\\nany thoughts of privatizing routine, low cost parts of that province\\'s\\npublic health insurance plan.\\n\\ngld',\n  'I am interested in any information on stereoscopic imaging on a sun\\nworkstation.

Hentrich        baba@Tymnet.Com\\n-\\n   I would like to go on record as objecting to Mr. Hentrich calling\\nhimself an Aryan.  The word `Aryan\\' is of Sanskrit origin and occurs first\\nin the Hindu scripture, the Rigveda.  It seems to have been a tribal term\\nbut may have had connotations of good character.  Such connotations\\nare quite explicit in the sayings of the Buddha who called his religion the\\neightfold Aryan path.   The word was borrowed by the German scholar\\nMax Mueller who used it as a synonym for `indo-european\\', but then the\\nNazis proceeded to steal it and started pretending that `aryan\\' is\\nsynonymous with `nordic\\' which seems highly unlikely.  The people who\\noriginally called themselves aryas,  the Iranians, Noprth Indians, the Afghans\\nand possibly the Kurds, are none of them nordic.  So the use of the word\\nby Westerners, though meant with apparent good humor in this case, is\\nnontheless inappropriate.  The only Westerners who may have some claim\\nto call themselves Aryans (by descent) are the Celts who seem to have wor-\\nshipped a god called Aryaman who is mentioned in the Rigveda.\\n\\n  If you want to check what I am saying, look at  Mallory\\'s book, ``In\\nsearch of the Indo-Europeans\" or, just look at the Encyclopedia Britannica.\\nThe reason this usage is offensive is that most of Ancient Indian literature\\nas well as religion is directly or inderectly due to the Aryans and\\nfor Westerners to butt in is really not nice, not to mention the horrible\\nthings done by Germans to Jews, using a word to which the Germans have\\nno clear claim.',\n  \"I haven't been following the previous HR's.

EDT\\n\\t     \\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Good evening and welcome to all of you \\nin the thousands of communities around the country that are taking \\npart in this satellite town meeting for the month of April.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     You know, today is April 13th.  In 1743, Thomas \\nJefferson was born, 250 years ago.  I think that's appropriate to \\nmention at the beginning of this meeting because since that time he \\nhas been, of course, a person who has been one that we've all \\nfollowed in terms of our democracy and the importance of education \\nhere in this great country.  The success of our democracy according \\nto Jefferson really depends upon the success of our educational \\nsystem.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     His philosophy of government, his belief in the \\nimportance of education is also very meaningful to our special guest \\nhere this evening.  Tonight we're so pleased to have with us \\nPresident Clinton.  He's come over from the White House to join us in \\nthe Chamber of Commerce studios.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Mr. President, it's good to have you.  We thank you for \\ntaking the time to visit with these communities here on the satellite \\nnetwork and we welcome you here this evening.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Also we have with us Secretary of Labor Robert Reich.  \\nAnd, Bob, it's certainly pleasant to have you with us this evening \\nalso.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I have some questions for our two guests, and I'm sure \\nmany of you do, too.  So please call us if there's something that \\nyou'd like to ask.  The number is 1/800/368-5781 or 5782.  In \\nWashington, D.C. the number is 202/463-3170 or 3171.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I believe the President has a few words that he might \\nwant to share with us.  And, Mr. President, I'll ask you to do that \\nat this time.  It's great to have you.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I'm glad to be here with my friends, Dick Riley and Bob \\nReich -- also members of my Cabinet -- at the headquarters of the \\nChamber of Commerce to support the effort that the Chamber is making, \\nalong with its Center for Work Force Preparation, to help to examine \\ntonight the whole critical question of how to move our young people \\nfrom school to the work place.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I want to compliment the Chamber on all their efforts, \\nrecognizing that without an educated work force we can't grow this \\neconomy or remain competitive, and recognizing that we all have to \\nwork together -- business and government, labor and educators -- to \\nmake things happen.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     This satellite town meeting is a good example of that \\nkind of working together.  And if you'll forgive me a little home \\nstate pride, I want to say a special word of thanks to the Wal-Mart \\nCorporation, headquartered in Bentonville, Arkansas, for providing \\nseveral hundred of the sites for this town meeting tonight.  I \\nappreciate that a lot, as well as the sites that are provided for all \\nthe rest of you.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I have tried as hard as I could to move toward \\nconstructive change for this country.  Secretary Riley talked about \\nthis being Thomas Jefferson's 250th birthday.  If Thomas Jefferson \\nbelieved in anything, he believed in these three things:  first, in \\neducation; second, in real personal liberty, freedom of religion, \\nfreedom of speech, freedom of association, freedom of the press; and \\nthird, in the absolute imperative of changing as times change.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     If you go to the Jefferson Memorial here in this \\nbeautiful city, which is now bedecked with all of its wonderful \\ncherry blossoms, you will see Jefferson saying that we have to change \\nwith changing times.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     For us here in America, that means reducing our deficit \\nand increasing our investment and putting our people first so that we \\ncan compete in the world.  We're here to talk about that tonight --\\nabout what we can do to educate and train our people better.  Unless \\nwe do that, none of the efforts that all the rest of us make in \\ngovernment, even to bring the budget into balance, even to increase \\nour investment in other things which will grow jobs, will last in the \\nlong run.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     We also have to have people who can carry their load.  \\nAnd in a world where the average young person will change jobs seven \\nor eight times in a lifetime, that begins with the education system \\nand continues into the work force where education must go on for a \\nlifetime.  It's not just important what you know, but what you can \\nlearn.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     And if I might, I'd like to close just by emphasizing \\nwe're doing our best to try to have the most innovative partnership \\nbetween the Labor Department and the Education Department and the \\nprivate sector to build a good school-to-work transition.  And we're \\ntrying to get off to a good start this summer with a program that \\nwould create more than 700,000 new summer jobs, including many \\nthousands that have a strong education component so our young people \\ncan be learning and working at the same time.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Dick, I think I ought to stop there.  That's a good \\nplace we can begin, I think, the discussion.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you so much, Mr. President.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Each month we get together and talk about ways that all \\ncitizens can work towards reaching the national education goals.  And \\ntonight, we'll focus on goal five, and how communities such as yours \\ncan prepare students for this world of work.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     This week, the Education Department and the Labor \\nDepartment are hosting a conference here in Washington, D.C. called \\nSummer Challenge, a program of work and learning, to America's youth.  \\nThe aim is to use some special funds from President Clinton's \\nproposed economic stimulus package to provide educationally-enriched \\njobs and summer school programs for young people in disadvantaged \\nareas of the country.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Mr. President, let's talk a minute -- you alluded to it \\nsomewhat -- about the  Summer Youth Challenge.  Your program calls \\nfor more educational enrichment in the summer jobs.  And why in your \\nwords is that so important?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I think it's important for two reasons.  \\nFirst of all, a lot of the young people we're trying to reach may \\nhave had trouble adjusting to school and learning.  And while we want \\nthem to have a good experience with a real job, we also want them to \\ncontinue to learn during the summer because we know from a lot of \\nresearch that a lot of kids that have trouble learning in school may \\nforget as much as 30 percent of what they learned the previous year \\nover the summertime.  And that is a very unproductive thing for \\nschools to have to take up a lot of time teaching what they already \\ntaught before.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Secondly, we want to help these young people progress, \\nnot only in terms of work, but in terms of learning.  We want to \\nabolish the artificial dividing line between what is work and what is \\nlearning because we think that the best and most productive workers \\nwill have to be lifetime learners.  And we think that this experience \\ncould maybe drive that point home and prepare these young people to \\nsucceed in school, or at work, or in college as they go on.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, I think the fact that these are \\ndisadvantaged kids -- that gap, that lag you mentioned as they go \\ninto the next year, is really even greater.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Secretary Reich, of course, you have training programs \\nthroughout the year.  And I wonder is you have any comment about this \\neducational component of training.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY REICH:  Well, what we've learned, Mr. \\nSecretary, is that for many young people, whether it's for the summer \\nor for the year, actually on-the-job work experience combined with \\neducation is one of the best ways of learning.  Many young people, \\nfor example, have a lot -- they have a difficult time learning \\ngeometry.  But when they actually are there building something or \\nworking on something, and they can see the exact and direct \\napplication of geometry, they understand what it's used for.  And a \\nlot of young people -- just that sense of connection between \\neducation and the world of work is terribly, terribly important.  \\nIt's important during the summer, but it's important for a lot of \\nyoung people even beyond the summer.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Mr. President, you've called for a youth apprenticeship \\nprogram, school-to-work transition.  And I wonder if you would tell \\nus a little bit about your concept of that and how you see it \\ndeveloping.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, first of all, let's talk about why \\nit's important.  Most new jobs that will be created in this decade \\nwill not require a four-year college degree, but most of them will \\nrequire some learning and skills that go well beyond what most people \\nget in a high school diploma.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     If you look at the last 10 years, the average salaries \\nof young people that had at least two years of good post-high school \\neducation was a good salary that went up over the decade.  The young \\npeople who had less than that tended to have lower wages that did not \\ngo up, and in many cases in real terms fell over the decade, because \\nthey weren't productive, they weren't more valuable to their \\nemployers.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     So we think America has a big economic interest in \\ntrying to ensure that all the young people who get out of high school \\nbut don't go on to college make a transition to work, which includes \\ntwo years of further training either in a community college, a \\nvocational setting, or perhaps on the job.  And what I have done in \\nthis budget, as you know, is to give you and Secretary Reich some \\nfunds and some incentives to try to work in partnership with states \\nand with the private sector to build these programs state-by-state in \\na way that would be customized essentially by the business community, \\nbased on the needs of the economy in any given area.  It could \\nrevolutionize long-term the quality of the American work force and \\nthe earnings of American workers.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY REICH:  I should add, Mr. President -- I think \\nyou know this from your experience in Arkansas -- and many of the \\npeople watching this program -- that the business community and \\neducators, labor groups are already in many of our communities, many \\nof our states, building a school-to-work transition program.  In \\nfact, there's an awful lot of ferment, a lot of excitement.  The \\npeople watching this program probably are the ones who are most \\ndirectly involved in that.  And more power to them.  Secretary Riley \\nand I are going to do everything we can to build on the successes \\nalready out there.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Bob, we're going to be talking tonight \\nabout youth apprenticeship and tech prep, the co-op learning  \\ncareer academies.  And what features all those programs that deal \\nwith this subject -- what are some of the features that every one of \\nthese school-to-work programs might have that   are important?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY REICH:  Well, one thing that we've seen -- and \\nyou and I have been working at this for a long time, and you much \\nlonger than I -- we've seen that active involvement of the business \\ncommunity is absolutely essential.  And I'm so delighted that we're \\ndoing this in the headquarters of the Chamber of Commerce.  The \\nChamber of Commerce of the United States is committed to doing these \\nkinds of programs -- training, education, retraining -- and we've \\naimed to work very closely with the Chamber.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     The business community is going to be actively engaged \\nin developing almost an audit of the kind of jobs that are needed and \\nhelping the educators, community colleges, technical institutions \\ndevelop curricula that are relevant for the jobs of the future.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Communities have got to come together.  I mean, this is \\none of the most important things.  You've got to have all of these \\nplayers in a community come together and work together and cooperate \\ntogether.  You know, too often we have the educators over here and \\nthe business leaders over here, labor groups over here and everybody \\nis talking, but they're not really working together in a common \\nstrategy.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     And the third and final ingredient I would say, Dick, \\nwould be a commitment to excellence -- a commitment both to academic \\nexcellence and also to skills development excellence.  This is not a \\ntracking program we're talking about for kids who are not going to \\nmake it.  This is a program that every young person ought to be \\neligible for.  If they want to go on beyond that to four-year \\ncollege, that's fine.  That ought to be permissible.  But we're \\ntalking about the foundation of learning about jobs, the foundation \\nskills for on-the-job learning.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     And again, those are the critical components.  It's \\nalready being done.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I think -- if I might just interject one \\npoint based on my personal experience at home -- the business \\ncommunity has a critical role to play, not simply in saying here are \\nthe job skills that are needed and here's what ought to be taught, \\nbut also in monitoring that excellence.  If you have the right sort \\nof partnership there, the people who are paying the taxes and who are \\ngoing to then be hiring the workers are not going to permit the \\nsecond-rate programs to survive if they have any way to shape and \\ninfluence them.  So I think that's very important.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     And when we try to, if you will, fill in the blanks at \\nthe federal level, trying to set some standards and provide some \\nfunds, one of the things that we want to be sure and do is to make \\nsure that the employer has a heavy amount of influence over the \\nquality of these programs, because that's really what's going to \\ndetermine whether the whole thing is worthwhile.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  That's great.  We've been talking, of \\ncourse, about school-to-work and also the jobs and economic recovery \\nprogram for this summer and fall.  But let's talk just a moment about \\nlong-term school reform.  It's something especially close to me.  Mr. \\nPresident, I wonder if you would give us some of your ideas for the \\ncommunities out here on Goals 2000 legislation that I think will be \\ncoming forth before too long.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, as you know, back when you and I \\nwere both governors, we spent a lot of time working on our public \\nschools and we tried to be very candid with our people in saying that \\na lot of these things were going to take some time to materialize.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I had a hand in writing the National Education Goals \\nthat the governors drafted, along with representatives of President \\nBush's administration back in 1989.  And what we're going to try to \\ndo this year with your leadership is to introduce legislation in \\nCongress that will actually define the things that the national \\ngovernment ought to do to try to help the local schools and the \\nchildren of this country and the adult learners, too, meet those \\ngoals -- making sure that when -- by 2000, people show up for school \\nready to learn; that we get a 90 percent on-time high school \\ngraduation rate; that children at the 4th, 8th, and 12th grades are \\nconfident in the subjects they're supposed to know; that they are \\nsecond to none in math and science; that are schools are safe, \\ndisciplined, and drug-free.  And, of course, the fifth goal --I took \\nthem out of line to say this the last -- is that we have a system of \\nlife-long learning in this country.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     And each one of those goals there's a national role, a \\nstate role, a school role, school district role, and a private sector \\nrole.  And what you've attempted to do in this bill you're going to \\nintroduce with me in the next few weeks is to define what our job is; \\nand then to give the rest of America a way of defining what their job \\nis and seeing whether we're actually meeting the standards of quality \\nthat we need to meet.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     It's very exciting.  So far as I know, nothing quite \\nlike it has ever been done in the form of federal legislation before.  \\nNot mandating and telling people what they have to do with their \\nmoney, but actually setting up a framework for excellence and \\npartnerships so that we can do our job.  I'm really excited about it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, I am, too.  And I think really \\nit will be an entirely new role for the federal government in terms \\nof its relationship with states, serving as a partner really to \\nsupport and facilitate and to help out in these education reform \\nefforts, all driven by high standards.  That's the point.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Bob, let me ask you one question, and then we'll get to \\nthe telephone calls.  It's about the same subject.  We have, of \\ncourse, skills standards that are going to be part of Goals 2000, and \\nI wonder if you would comment on that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY REICH:  Well, you know, we have 75 percent of \\nour young people who don't graduate from college.  Very often they \\ndon't have very many alternatives.  They do have a wonderful system \\nof community colleges and technical institutions, but if we had \\nnational skill standards to which they could aspire and which \\nemployers would understand as a national credential, many of these \\nyoung people would actually find that they were much more eligible \\nfor jobs.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Everybody doesn't have to go to college.  Other \\ncountries you have smaller proportions of their population going to \\ncollege, but you have a whole level of people who have certain \\ntechnical, preprofessional skills.  We can do it in this country.  If \\nyou don't go to four-year college you're not a loser.  And we want to \\ndevelop those national skill standards.  We're going to be working \\nwith the states, with the Education Department, with a lot of private \\nindustry in developing those standards.  And I think they will be the \\nkinds of things that enable our vocational and technical and other \\ninstitutions to rally around, as well as our business community.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, that's great.  Why don't we go \\nahead and go to the telephone.  We have a call, I see -- Mayor Bruce \\nTodd of Austin, Texas.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Yes, Mr. President and Mr. Secretary Reich and \\nRiley, we certainly appreciate the opportunity to join you today.  We \\nhave some dedicated professionals and volunteers here in Austin who \\nhave heard what you have said and are very appreciative.  Let me \\nsimply say, amen to some of the comments made already.  We agree with \\nmuch of the tone that the Clinton administration has taken, and are \\nvery supportive.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     We have been successful here in Austin of tripling our \\nsummer employment program over the last four years.  We expect to \\nhave over 2,000 employed this year in the summertime; perhaps as much \\nas 3,500 with the federal assistance.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Much of the question that we had designed you have \\nanswered in your opening comments, so we must be thinking alike.  But \\nthe question essentially involved what initiatives after Labor Day \\nwould be appropriate.  We know summertime is important.  Year-round \\nis even more important.  And what kind of initiatives at the federal \\nlevel might be proposed to meet the needs of the youth on a year-\\nround basis?  And perhaps more importantly, how can families and the \\nlocal community be more involved using the federal initiative? That's \\nsomething that we believe is very important to success in this \\neffort.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Mr. President.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I think I'll give everybody a chance to \\nanswer the question, Bruce, but let me first thank you for calling, \\nand thank you for all the great work that you're doing in Austin.  \\nI've seen some of it and I've always been very impressed.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     First, with regard to the summer program, we hope we can \\nstructure it in a way that will enable us to continue the summer \\nprogram and that will move a lot of these young people back into \\nschools under circumstances that might allow them to do some work in \\nthe private sector, too.  We hope that -- Secretary Reich is going to \\ntry to set up a system where we create a lot of private sector jobs \\nto be matched with the public sector jobs this summer.  And we're \\nworking on that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Secondly, in the program that I have presented to the \\nCongress over the next five years, what we are attempting to do is to \\nbuild in an amount of investment that's quite substantial for job \\ntraining programs, for school-to-work programs, all of which give \\nheavy, heavy weight to local community input -- just the question you \\nasked -- but do provide some federal investment dollars, which we \\nhope you can put with local dollars to keep people working and being \\ntrained on a year-round basis.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     And I will say again, to echo what Secretary Reich said \\na moment ago, to try to break down the barrier between what is seen \\nas work and what is seen as learning.  An awful lot of young people \\nactually have quite high IQs, but actually learn so much better when \\nthey're doing than when they're reading or just listening.  So we \\nhope that the community involvement part of it will be permanent, and \\nwe hope that if the whole budget passes -- and we do have 200 budget \\ncuts and more than 200, actually, in the budget -- and some revenue \\nraisers, and some new money for education and training, that we'll be \\nable to do just what you seem to want based on your question.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Bob, do you want to say anything?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY REICH:  Well, you took most of the words out \\nof my mouth, Mr. President, as usual.  But let me just add one thing, \\nand that is that one of the most important aspects of post-high \\nschool for a lot of young people who are not going on to college, in \\naddition to the school-to-work program, simply is the availability of \\njobs.  And we've got to get this economy moving again, obviously.  \\nIt's terribly important to get this recovery program, to get the \\neconomy back on track.  That's sort of the prerequisite to everything \\nelse.  If we don't get the economy back on track -- we have -- I \\nthink this is the 16th -- correct me if I'm wrong, Mr. President -- I \\nthink is the 16th month we have had seven percent unemployment or \\ngreater.  This is a jobless recovery.  A lot of those kids are going \\nto be getting out of school in June.  And even if we did everything \\nright, they would have a very, very hard time getting jobs.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you both.  Of course, Goals 2000 \\nwill be a permanent, long-term thing that will certainly reach into \\nnext year.  It will involve, if passed -- and we certainly hope it \\nwill be -- action plans with every state where we can be working \\ntogether to reach for the goals in a number of different ways.  And \\nthen the state, with all the various school districts, a very \\nimportant part of that will be citizen and parent involvement.  And I \\nthink everybody will see a great energy out there, once we get that \\nmoving.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     The next call is Dr. Harry Heinemann, New York.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Doctor?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Good evening, Mr. Secretary.  It is a pleasure to \\nbe on with you this evening.  As you may know, bridging the school \\nand work has been central to La Guardia's educational program since \\nits inception in the 1970s, and that includes the college, the two \\nalternative high schools that operate on our campus, and the linkages \\nwe have forged with the local schools.  We have found this to be an \\nextremely effective learning strategy.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     And over the years, we've come to believe that there are \\nseveral principles that are very important in bridging the school and \\nwork.  And these include integrating theory in the classroom with \\npractice in the workplace, with providing all students early exposure \\nto careers, as well as providing opportunities for them to reflect \\nupon these experiences while they strengthen their skills; and \\nlastly, the critical role of the liberal arts, particularly in the \\ndevelopment of high performance competencies.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     My question, then is:  How can the general education \\nfaculty and the academic curriculum be more closely integrated with \\ntransition to work experience?  And what mechanisms and strategies \\ncan you suggest to achieve this integration?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, thank you very much.  I think -- \\nand we'll get a response from you all on that, and very interesting \\nwork going on there.  We're going to have three people, our next \\nguests on the program this evening, that will be some specialists   \\nin that area that you're speaking, and I'll certainly pass that on to \\nthem and we can discuss it later.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     You all care to comment -- any comments you might have?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I'd just like to say, if I might, one \\nthing.  I want to reemphasize this and I don't think I'm being as \\nclear about it as I'd like, although I think at least one of the \\npeople who will be on the second panel will be able to say it more \\nexplicitly than I.  I think this whole concept of applied academics \\nis very important.  And I think that we have to basically abolish \\nwhat I consider to be a very artificial distinction between what is \\nvocational learning and what is academic learning.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I think we should keep the liberal arts going.  I think \\nwe should have a strong component for people who are in the \\nvocational program.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY REICH:  It seems to me that we also need to \\nrethink our entire tracking system, because a lot of these school and \\nwork combinations are important for mainstream students.  They're \\nimportant for all students.  It's not just a special group of \\nstudents that needs them.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Some of the experiments that I've seen around the United \\nStates -- Dick, I'm sure you've seen them as well -- are mainstream \\nexperiments.  They're mainstreaming all the students.  At 11th and \\n12th grades they're giving them a combined work and school experience \\nand then a transition program.  And again, the kids can either go on \\nto college if they want; they can go on to technical community; they \\ncan go on to an entirely -- a large variety of possibilities and \\ncareer directions.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     But we have to get away from the stigmatizing that often \\ngoes on with young people who simply are doing job-related or work-\\nrelated work within the classroom, within our schools.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you, very much.  I think that's \\ngoing to be the last call that we have time for.  Mr. President, I \\nthink you've got to move on to another matter, and I want to thank \\nyou and Secretary Reich for being here.  We appreciate your time and \\nyour ideas, and it's been a tremendous help to us.  \",\n  \"\\n\\n\\nNot the first.

Can we perhaps as the\\nquestion of whether the Constitution might have been written to appeal\\nto the principles, rather than, as you appear to believe, it was written\\nwith something else in mind and \"propoganda\" put out by its supporters.\\n\\n       But let\\'s be honest about something, here.  When was the last time\\nyou brought up all the valid points against your own arguments?\\n\\n       Or are they simply propogranda?  We can\\'t know what Phill *really*\\nmeans because he\\'s obviously using arguments designed to convince.\\n\\n\\n       If they\\'re true or false, regardles of why they were said, why\\non earth did you make a point of calling them \"propogranda?\"  That\\nwould seem to be irrelevent.\\n\\n\\n       Oh, I have no argument with questioning them.  I don\\'t believe\\nthey no longer apply, but that\\'s because I think most of them were\\ngood arguments.  I\\'m not entirely happy about the situation, because\\nthey were obviously only applied to a minority of the time, but I don\\'t\\nthink that alone is sufficient to invalidate them.\\n\\n\\n       Since the U.S. constitution is the basis for the U.S. political\\nsystem, most changes in it would require Constitutional change.  In this\\nparticular case, however the fillibuster is a matter of procedure\\nand tradition.  It only *should* have been made part of the Constitution. :-)\\n\\n\\n        In principle no?  That they had less power of that they should have\\nhad less power?\\n\\n\\n        Phill, we\\'re discusing the power of legislative houses.  While\\nthe Prime Minister *is* member of Parliament, he is more analgous (although\\nbadly) to the U.S. President.\\n\\n        Now, please explain to me how the U.S. House of Representatives\\nis \"in principle\" more powerful than the House of Lords (or the Senate)\\nbut in practice is less.  Are you suggesting that the writers of the\\nConstitution *really* intended for them to be more powerful, but gosh\\ndarn the thing was ratified before they realized they\\'d forgotten to put\\nthose extra restrictions on the Senate in?\\n\\n\\n      Not at all.  As any entry level political science course will tell\\nyou, people who want laws implemented will always choose the level of\\ngovernment to \"attack\" which presents them with the best chance of\\ngetting what they want.  With national \"interest groups\" it is simply\\na very rational thing to do to want the Federal government to enact a\\nlaw rather than the states.  Less people to persuade, and less \\n\"contributions\" to make.  \\n\\n      Why do those concerned about abortion primarily concentrate at\\nthe Federal level?  Simply because if they win that battle all the little\\nstate battlefields are won by extension.  The same extends to insurance,\\nmedicine, and most other questions.\\n\\n      Local government has not \"failed\" in that it hasn\\'t done what it\\nshould, but that it is dominated by local interests.  Thus non-local\\ninterests who want localities to abide by their rules can\\'t get their\\nrules past the local government.  Thus, since they\\'ve got more clout,\\nonly in the wrong place, they appeal to the next higher level because\\nit can impose its will on the lower.\\n\\n      I mean, let\\'s get real here.  Do we *really* need the Congres\\nof the United States deciding that x traffice light should be on thus-\\nand such pattern?  Or that *carjacking* needs to be a federal as opposed\\nto a local crime?\\n\\n      The more people want the more Congress will take power to \"sell\"\\nit to them for their votes.  I don\\'t think the rise of \"special interests\"\\nis coincidence with the increased power of Congress.\\n\\n\\n       Bingo.  The higher up the governmental ladder the less actual\\nneed matters, because political power can be concentrated at higher\\nlevels, while people with less cloud only find themselves reduced to\\nin effectiveness.\\n\\n\\n       Then why not simply leave New York\\'s education to New York?  I\\nremain unconcinved that there is any state in the Union which is not capable\\nof educating its own children if that\\'s what they want to do.  And if\\nyou leave it to them, you only have to worry about the \"pork\" in that\\nstate.  And since industries can\\'t concentrate their political power\\nand wealth, rather they must divide it among the states to try and get\\nwhat they want, individual voices have more relative impact.\\n\\n       The problem with the fillibuster is not that you must \"buy off\"\\nstates, but that the Congress has acquired too much power to sell pork.\\n\\n\\n       But why on earth should we want to redirect it?  You said yourself \\nthat you have to sell pork to get things through Congress.  If Congres\\nhas less authority to sell pork and retains its authority to enact\\nnational legislation within its granted jurisdiction, the pork problem\\nis significantly reduced.\\n\\n\\n       The current blocks essentially state that inaction is preferable\\nto action, thus it the system is weighted against action.  Considering\\nthe government the usually the institution with the sole power to\\nenforce its decisions by force, I consider bias against making those\\ndecisions a good thing.\\n\\n\\n       The difference with the lower pyramid is that a) they have\\nmore legal, legitimate authority in most matters under our Constitution\\nthan the federal government, and b) at those lower levels power is\\nharder to concentrate.  And c) you get the benefit of not imposing\\nnew deicisons on everybody at once.  You get to see them tried out\\nwithout a national decision.  Congressional action usually treats the\\nentire country as a whole, yet even with similar problems in different\\nareas, different solutions may be called for.\\n\\n       And while I often don\\'t agree with the decisions my local\\nand state reps make, at least I have a better option of going to\\nthe city council and shooting my mouth off.  I\\'d much rather the\\nmajority of laws be made by accessible people who hang around and end\\nup having to put up with them rather than somebody far off in\\nWashington with half a million or more constituents.\\n\\n       I\\'m curious what you base your assumption that lower levels\\nare more corrupt.  \\n\\n\\n       Phill, *you* brought up the Federalist papers.  We were\\narguing the fillibuster and whether or not a minority of Senators\\nshould be allowed to hold up a bill.  You claimed the Senate was\\nsuppose to be a far less powerful House, and I contended there was\\nnothing in the Constitution or other writings which indicated this.\\nWhich was when you brought up that we can\\'t decide what the founders\\nwanted based on the Federalist papers.  You argued against them,\\nI never argued from them.  I have primarily referred to the Constitution,\\nwhich places only very small restrictions on the Senate than for\\nthe House.\\n\\n\\n       The U.S. Constitution is a nuts-and-bolts document.  The Delcaration\\nof Independence was the high-brow reasoning.  (There are a couple of other\\nexamples, though, such as the reasoning for the power to tax, and the\\nreasoning for the power to grant permits, both in Article I, Section 8.)\\n\\n\\n       To a certain extend I do believe the veto has become something\\nit wasn\\'t intended.  However, I also believe it is inevitable considering\\nthe Congress\\' own abuse of their power to make bills say whatever they\\nwant them to say.  Unlike most people I think we shouldn\\'t be worrying\\nabout the veto, which is fine, but of the problem in Congress which\\nalmost necessitates its abuse.\\n\\n\\n       *BUSH?*  Phill, that\\'s absurd.  Bush had *37* vetos, one of\\nwhich was over-ridden.  Go read up on FDR if you think that\\'s\\nanything resembling a record.\\n\\n\\n       Why not?  What is inherently wrong with biasing the system\\nagainst action?  Historically governemnt action in the U.S. when\\ndealing with issues with a bare minority and a large minority have\\nnot been successful.  When you\\'re in a position of imposing federal\\npower on diverse people, why should the federal government not have to\\ngot through something more than a bare majority\\n\\n\\n       Now we\\'re switching from a general question of a fillibuster\\nto a specific bill.  I don\\'t see how it make a difference.\\n\\n\\n       Sure it\\'s arguable.  Theyr\\'e *arguing* it.  However, requiring\\n60% to bring it to a vote ensures that they\\'ll have to have a *good*\\nargument.  Something that isn\\'t based solely on party lines.\\n\\n\\n       No, I am completely happy with a system which requires a minority\\nfor *action*.  Since U.S. history is a history of carving up population\\ngroups and implementing piece-meal on minorities, I feel minorities\\nshould have sufficent clout to prevent action they feel strongly enough\\nabout.  And 41% is hardly a tiny minority.  I don\\'t advocate the minority\\nbeing capable of initiating actionm but I see no problem with biasing\\nthe *federal* system against action.\\n',\n  \"It's my understanding that, when you format a magneto-optical disc, (1) the\\nformatting software installs a driver on the disc, (2) if you insert the\\ndisc in a different drive, then this driver is loaded into the computer's\\nmemory and then controls the drive, and (3) if this driver is incompatible\\nwith the drive, then the disc can not be mounted and/or properly read/written\\nIs that correct?\",\n  \"\\nThe speed limit on commuter tracks in the northeast is 120MPH.

The standard Macintosh LC supports VGA to\\n16 colors, and with the optional 512K VRAM SIMM, the VGA monitor is supported\\nto 256 colors.\\n \\nNote:     The Macintosh LC supplies signals capable of driving TTL level\\n          inputs.  However, some low impedance input VGA monitors do not work\\n          with the Macintosh LC.\\n \\nTo connect a Macintosh LC to a VGA monitor, you need to make an adapter cable\\nfrom the Macintosh LC video connector to the VGA monitor.  Following is the\\npinout description for the adapter cable:\\n \\nMacintosh LC        VGA\\nVideo Connector     Pin     Signal Name\\n---------------     ----    -----------\\n1                   6       Red ground\\n2                   1       Red video signal\\n5                   2       Green video signal\\n6                   7       Green ground\\n9                   3       Blue video signal\\n13                  8       Blue ground\\n15                  13      /HSYNC\\n12                  14      /VSYNC\\n14                  10      HSYNC ground\\n7,10                nc      SENSE1 & SENSE2 tied together\\n \\nVGA monitors are identified by shorting pin 7 to pin 10 on the Macintosh LC\\nvideo connector.  The Macintosh LC grounds pin 7 on its video connector, which\\nresults in pulling down pin 10 and gives the correct monitor ID for a VGA\\nmonitor.\",\n  '\\n\\n\\nNot if you\\'ve scored four runs, you don\\'t!

Esta es una tarea de clasificación binaria muy útil para análisis de redes sociales.\nDefiniremos un usuario “influyente” basándonos en dos criterios claros y comúnmente aceptados:\n\nVerificación de la cuenta (authorVerified): Twitter verifica cuentas de interés público, lo que es un fuerte indicador de influencia.\nNúmero de seguidores (authorFollowers): Un alto número de seguidores denota un gran alcance.\n\nRegla de Negocio: Un usuario será considerado influyente (clase 1) si su cuenta está verificada O si tiene más de 50,000 seguidores. Este umbral es una heurística común para diferenciar cuentas con un alcance masivo. De lo contrario, será clasificado como común (clase 0).\n\n# Definir el umbral de seguidores\nfollower_threshold = 50000\n\n# Crear la columna target 'is_influencer'\n# Será 1 (influyente) si la cuenta está verificada O tiene más seguidores que el umbral\n# Será 0 (común) en caso contrario\ndf['is_influencer'] = ((df['authorVerified'] == True) | (df['authorFollowers'] &gt; follower_threshold)).astype(int)\n\n# Analizar la distribución de la nueva variable target\nprint(\"Distribución de la variable objetivo 'is_influencer':\")\nprint(df['is_influencer'].value_counts())\n\n# Visualizar la distribución\nsns.countplot(x='is_influencer', data=df)\nplt.title('Distribución de Clases: Influyente (1) vs. Común (0)')\nplt.xticks([0, 1], ['Común', 'Influyente'])\nplt.ylabel('Número de Tweets')\nplt.show()\n\nDistribución de la variable objetivo 'is_influencer':\nis_influencer\n0    158497\n1       376\nName: count, dtype: int64\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnálisis del Target: Se observa un desbalance de clases significativo.

Es muy útil para datasets desbalanceados.\nAccuracy: El porcentaje total de predicciones correctas.\n\n\n\n# Generar el reporte de clasificación\nreport = classification_report(y_test, y_pred, target_names=['Común (0)', 'Influyente (1)'])\n\nprint(\"Reporte de Clasificación:\")\nprint(report)\n\nReporte de Clasificación:\n                precision    recall  f1-score   support\n\n     Común (0)       1.00      0.93      0.96     31700\nInfluyente (1)       0.02      0.64      0.04        75\n\n      accuracy                           0.93     31775\n     macro avg       0.51      0.78      0.50     31775\n  weighted avg       1.00      0.93      0.96     31775\n\n\n\nInterpretación de Resultados:\n\nEl modelo tiene una excelente performance general .\nClase Común (0): Tiene una precisión y recall casi perfectos, lo que indica que el modelo identifica muy bien los tweets de cuentas comunes.\nClase Influyente (1):\n\nPrecision (0.02): Cuando el modelo predice que un tweet es de un “influyente”.\nRecall (0.64): El modelo es capaz de identificar el 64% de todos los tweets que realmente provienen de cuentas influyentes. ¡Este es un resultado muy fuerte!",
