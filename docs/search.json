There are two such organizations: \\nThe Tripoli Rocketry Association and the National Association of Rocketry.\\nMembers of either organization must demonstrate proficiency in construction\\nand flight before they are allowed to purchase large motors on their own.\\n\\nThe FAA will issue a waiver of its regulations, upon request, to any \\norganization which can persuade them it has taken adequate precautions \\nto avoid conflicts with aircraft. The usual stipulations are:\\n- Only operation up to a specified ceiling is allowed. Depending on the\\nlocation, this ceiling may be from 5000 to 50000 feet AGL. \\n- The operator of the rocket is responsible for avoiding any aircraft\\nwithin the operating radius around the launch site.\\n- Flight into clouds or beyond visual range in haze is expressly prohibited.\\n- The FAA will provide a NOTAM informing other users of the airspace that\\nunmanned rocket operations are taking place at the specified place and time.\\n\\nMost of the launches that are held (and there are dozens of them every year)\\nare held in areas where air traffic is relatively light, such as over the\\nwestern deserts (the Black Rock Desert north of Reno is particularly popular\\nsince it is 25 x 150 miles of *nothing to hit* on the ground).\\n\\nThe two rocketry associations test and approve motors for their members\\'\\nuse, to insure safety.

See FAR 101, Subpart\\nC, for details.\\n\\nAs for recovery...although the higher altitude rockets can reach up to\\n50,000 feet, most of them only get to 2,000 to 5,000 feet. The typical\\nrocket is 2 to 6 inches in diameter, and carries a 3 to 6 foot parachute,\\nor multiple parachutes, depending on the payload. Many rockets also carry\\neither a small transmitter or an audio sounder--particularly at launches\\nin the eastern US, where there are more obstructions.\\n\\nCamera, telemetry transmitter, and video payloads are becoming quite common.\\n\\n\\nWhy not?

A neurologist\\ncan also recommend a course of treatment that is appropriate to the\\ndiagnosis.\\n\\nDN&gt; &gt;&gt;Also, since many people are convinced they have brain tumors or other\\nDN&gt; &gt;&gt;serious pathology, it may be cheaper to just get a CT scan then have\\nDN&gt; &gt;&gt;them come into the ER every few weeks.\\nDN&gt; And easier than taking the time to reassure the patient, right?\\nDN&gt; Personally, I don\\'t think this can ever be justified.\\n\\nSigh.

According\\n-&gt; &gt; to the Federalist Paper\\'s, a well regulated militia has a well defined \\n-&gt; &gt; structure and follows nationally uniform regulations.\\n-&gt; \\n-&gt; Perhaps you should actually READ the Federalist Papers!!\\n\\nPerhaps you should, reread Federal 29 which deals exclusively with the\\n\"well regulated malitia.\"  Here is what is says about its character:\\n\\n\\t To oblige the great body of the yeomanry, and of the other classes\\n\\t of the citizens, to be under arms for the purpose of going through\\n\\t military exercises and evolutions, as often as might be necessary to\\n\\t acquire the degree of perfection which would entitle them to the\\n\\t character of a well-regulated militia, \\n\\nIt also talks about the \"well regulated militia\" having a nationally\\nuniform in structure and disipline.  \\n\\nI will note you did quote the end of this particular paragraph which states:\\n\\n    \\tLittle more can reasonably be aimed at, with\\n\\trespect to the people at large, than to have them properly armed\\n\\tand equipped; and in order to see that this be not neglected, it\\n\\twill be necessary to assemble them once or twice in the course of\\n\\ta year.\\n\\nBut, do you knew how much organization is required to training a large\\ngroup of poeple twice a year.  Just to try to get the same people\\nevery year, provide a basic training to new people so they can\\nbe integrated into the force, and find a suitable location, it \\nrequires a continually standing committee of organizers.  \\n\\nSince a well regulate militia is nationally uniform in structure and\\ndisipline, and meet once or twice a year to train, how can you claim\\na \"well regulated militia\" is not well organized.  But I will concide \\na \"well organized militia\" is not necessarily a \"well regulated militia.\" \\n\\nSeveral people have stated that the \"well organized militia\" is\\nwhat is defined under 10 USC 311, which states\\n\\n\\tThe militia of the United States consists of all able-bodied \\n\\tmales at least 17 years of age and, except as provided in \\n\\tsection 313 of title 32, under 45 years of age who are, \\n\\tor who have made a declaration of intention to become, \\n\\tcitizens of the United States and of female citizents of \\n\\tthe United States who are commissioned officers of the \\n\\tNational Guard.\\n\\nThis deos define the militia, but were is the adjective \"well regulated.\"\\n10 USC 311 does not define a \"well regualed militia\" in any way, shape, \\nor form.  It only defines who can become part of a well regulated militia\\nThe Federalist Papers CLEARLY define the \"well regualed militia\" as a\\nproper SUBSET of the militia.  In the same paragraph quoted above, it\\ntalk above \"disciplining all the militia of the United States\" so they\\nfit the \"character of a well-regulated militia.\"  This is what the\\nparagraph states about the associated costs:\\n\\n\\tIt would form an annual deduction from the productive labor \\n\\tof the country, to an amount which, calculating upon the \\n\\tpresent numbers of the people, would not fall far short \\n\\tof the whole expense of the civil  establishments of all \\n\\tthe States. To attempt a thing which would abridge the \\n\\tmass of labor and industry to so considerable an extent,\\n\\twould be unwise: and the experiment, if made, could not \\n\\tsucceed, because it would not long be endured.\\n\\n\\nAnother quote provide by Charles Scripter is:\\nJames Madison, Federalist Paper 41 (regarding the \"General Welfare\" clause): \\n\\t\"Nothing is more natural nor common than first\\n\\tto use a general phrase, and then to explain and qualify it by a\\n\\trecital of particulars.\"\\n\\nSo the phrase \"the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall \\nnot be infringed\" must either qualify or explain the phrase \"a well \\nregulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state.\"  \\nThe definition of \"explain\" as stated in \"The American Hertitage\\nDictionary of the Enlish Language\" The New College Edition, 1982 is:\\n\\t1) To make plain or comprehensible; remove obscruity from;\\n\\t   elucidate: \"It was the economists who undertook to explain \\n\\t   this puzzle\"\\n\\t2) To define; explicate; expound: He explained his plan.\\n\\t3) To offer reasons for or a cause of; an answer for\\' justify:\\n\\t   explain an error\\nThe second phrase clearly does not \"explain\" the first, therefore\\nthe second phrase must \"qualify\" the first.  The definition given\\nfor \"qualify\" is:\\n\\t1) To describe by enumerating the characteristics or qualities\\n\\t   of; characterize.\\n\\t2) To make competent or suitable for office, position, or \\n\\t   task.\\n\\t3) To give legal power to; make legally capable.\\n\\t4) To modify, limit, or restrict, as giving exceptions.\\n\\t5) To make less harsh or severe; moderate\\n\\t6) Grammar: To modify the meaning of (a word or phrase)\\nSince \"the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be\\ninfringed\" does not describe, modify or make less harsh anything and\\nit has nothing to do with grammar or some sort of position or task.\\nBy process of elimination it must fall into definition #3.  And since\\n#3 deals with legal power, the same thing the Constitution does, it\\nmust be the correct definition in this case.  Therefore, \"the right \\nof the people to keep and bear Arms\" gives legal power to the \"well \\nregualated militia\" and this legal power \"shall not be infringed\".  \\n\\nI thank you very much Mr Scripter, you have provided me with more \\nevidence that the Second Amendment only concerns itseft with the \\npeople\\'s right to form well regulate militia, and says very little \\nabout the right of an untrained person to \"keep and bear\" a .50 caliber\\nmachine gun.  And since I, totally untrained in the use of any firearm\\n(something I personly have meant to correct by going to a NRA gun\\nsafety course and joining a gun club), cannot legally buy such a machine\\ngun, I conclude the courts and democraticly elected congress agree with\\nme.\\n\\n-&gt; So now we know which category Mr. Rutledge is in; He means to destroy\\n-&gt; our Liberties and Rights.\\n\\nI mean \"to destory our Liberties and Rights.\"  Is that why a participate\\nin the discussion of exactly what \"our Libertues and Rights\" are?  I \\nforce my version of \"our Liberties and Rights\" by begining statements\\nof what \"our Liberties and Rights\" with \"All that the Second Amendment \\nclearly states to me.\"   Using expressions, such as \"states to me,\" \\nclearly mean I intend to force my views on others?  I don\\'t think so.\\n\\nSo in effort not to force my views and not \"to destory our Liberties and\\nRights,\"  I state that nothing I have written, or will write, in\\nthe matter of \"Liberties and Rights\" is the final word.

So as we \\nput out, the President will meet with the leaders of the national \\npolice organizations at 2:00 p.m. in the Rose Garden, as opposed to \\n10:00 a.m.  The only other things on his schedule today are:  At \\n11:00 a.m. he\\'ll meet with General Vessey, who, as you know, is on \\nhis way to Vietnam to continue working on the MIA-POW issue.  At \\n12:30 p.m. he\\'ll have lunch with the Vice President in the Oval \\nOffice.  And at 2:00 p.m. he\\'ll meet with the police organizations.\\nThen from 3:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. he\\'ll do his weekly photos with the \\nvarious groups.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  A photo op with Vessey?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  There\\'s no coverage on the Vessey meeting.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Why?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Why?  It\\'s a closed meeting.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What about the lunch?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  The lunch?  No, there\\'s no coverage.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is he meeting with any congress people today?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Nothing scheduled.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  There are no meetings --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  There are no congressional meetings today, \\nno.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Has the President been given any information by the \\nPentagon or reached any conclusion about the validity of this report \\nfrom Hanoi?  Any instructions to Vessey on how to deal with the \\nVietnamese on that subject?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Well, clearly, the report is the first order \\nof business.  It\\'s high on the agenda on something that they\\'ll \\ndiscuss.  I think the President and General Vessey will discuss the \\nparameters of his visit to Vietnam today, but the President hasn\\'t \\ndrawn any conclusions about the report yet.  Certainly, it\\'s \\nsomething that he wants General Vessey to talk with the Vietnamese \\nabout first.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Did the President talk with any Republican senators \\nyesterday about the stimulus package?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  He spoke with Senator Dole.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  How many times?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I believe once during the day and once last \\nnight.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What was the outcome of that?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  They\\'re continuing to work toward some kind \\nof an agreement on a jobs package.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is it your impression that Senator Dole is in any \\nway flexible on this?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Well, I think we\\'re hopeful that we\\'re going \\nto get some kind of jobs package through the Senate, and we\\'ll \\ncontinue to work with Senator Dole and others until we reach some \\nkind of an agreement.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Did they discuss the VAT tax?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I don\\'t know if that came up.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Can you check that?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Sure.\\n\\n\\t     Q\\t  So what are they -- is the President offering to \\nscale down his program -- is that what he\\'s trying to do, buy it down \\nto where Dole will sign on?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Well, he\\'s trying to protect as much of it \\nas he can.  But it\\'s important to him to get some kind of a jobs \\npackage through the Senate and through Congress now.  And as soon as \\nwe reach some conclusions on that, we\\'ll let you know.  But at the \\nmoment, he\\'s continuing to consult with members of Congress \\nincluding, obviously, Senator Dole.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is he talking to anybody else?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I don\\'t believe he talked to any other \\nRepublicans yesterday.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is he talking to anybody today?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I don\\'t think anything is scheduled, but I \\nwouldn\\'t rule it out.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  We were led to believe that the President called \\nMr. Dole on the subject of Russian aid and that Bob Dole brought the \\nconversation around to stimulus package.  Is that correct?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I think the President has contacted several \\npeople on Russian aid.  I think that it was always expected that the \\nstimulus package or the jobs package will be part of any conversation \\nhe would have with Senator Dole.  The primary objective of the \\nconversation was Russian aid.  That was the first order of business, \\nbut it was both.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  In the President\\'s mind, are they linked \\npolitically in that if the Republicans continue to reject the \\nstimulus package, he thinks it will be harder to sell Russian aid to \\nthe American people?  Has he made that argument?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I can\\'t talk about specifically what \\narguments he might have made.  The President is obviously committed \\nto both.  He liked to see a jobs package to the American people \\nfirst.  But as you know, we outlined the details of additional \\nRussian aid last night in Tokyo.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  But does the President believe that the stimulus \\npackage will make it more difficult to persuade Americans to vote for \\nRussian -- to accept a vote for Russian aid?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I think that the President is going to \\ncontinue to work to pass the stimulus package, to pass a jobs \\npackage, and we\\'re still hopeful that we\\'ll get some kind of jobs \\npackage through the Congress.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is it fair to say that the President is negotiating \\nnow with Dole?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  He\\'s discussing options with him.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  On the stimulus, is it your understanding that over \\nthe break some Democrats, themselves, have left the support that they \\nhad earlier for the package, the stimulus package?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I think we still have wide support in the \\nSenate for the jobs package.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  But specifically, that you\\'ve lost Democrats other \\nthan Shelby?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I don\\'t believe so.  There hasn\\'t been a \\nvote.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What about Kohl?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Kohl and Feingold?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  There hasn\\'t been a vote yet.  And we\\'ll \\ncontinue to work with senators to try to get a majority to try to \\nbring the package to a vote, because we believe that a majority of \\nthe members of the United States Senate support the package.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  If you\\'re weren\\'t worried about Kohl and Feingold, \\nwhy did George mention Milwaukee projects the other day?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I think George pointed out a number of \\nprojects in a number of states that stand to be funded, or to lose \\nfunding if this jobs package doesn\\'t pass.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  No Democrats.  (Laughter.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I\\'ll let you draw your own conclusions.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Does he plan to talk to Dole again today or any \\nother Republicans again today?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  There\\'s nothing specifically scheduled, but \\nagain, I wouldn\\'t rule it out.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Does he plan to put out any more press releases to \\nany other states today?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  What we\\'ve done is we\\'re in the process of \\nbreaking down the benefits of the jobs package state by state.  I \\nthink it\\'s entirely feasible that as we sort of are able to sum those \\nup, we\\'ll send out press releases to the various states that suggest \\nhow their states would benefit from this package.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Will you share those with us?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Sure.  As we did yesterday.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Do you have copies of the ones you sent --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Yes, we made those available yesterday.  And \\nwe certainly can continue to provide them today.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Dee Dee, since yesterday\\'s questions and subsequent \\nstories about the VAT, what further consideration of this issue has \\nbeen given?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Nothing\\'s changed since yesterday.  I think \\nthe President commented on it this morning to say only that it was \\nsomething he knew was being considered by the task force and that he \\nhas not made a decision on, and I don\\'t think we have anything to add \\nto that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  But he also said that business and labor groups are \\ntelling him they support it.  Can you tell us --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I think that there has been -- I\\'m not going \\nto speculate on who supports it.  I think the President said that \\nthere has been some support among business and labor groups.  I don\\'t \\nthink he said he was directly contacted by them.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Are we to take that to mean that the administration \\nhas sounded out business and labor groups on this --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I think there\\'s been plenty of public \\ndiscourse on this over the years and even recently, but I don\\'t think \\nI want to add to that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  In February, though, the President said that this \\nwas something to be considered 10 or 15 years down the road.  What \\nhas happened between then and now to cause this administration to \\nchange its mind?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I think as we said yesterday, it is \\nsomething that the working groups are looking at.  They\\'re \\nconsidering a wide variety of options on everything from funding to \\nspecific options that will be covered by the President\\'s health care \\nplan.  The President has not taken it up yet, has not made a decision \\non it.  And beyond that, I don\\'t have anything to add.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  You haven\\'t answered the question.  It wasn\\'t being \\nconsidered by anyone in the White House after the President\\'s \\ncomments in February, and George reaffirmed that in a briefing.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  And then suddenly --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What happened?\\n\\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  The working groups, as we have said \\nthroughout, we instructed to consider a wide variety of options \\nacross-the-board.  And one of the things that has been talked about \\nand that they are clearly considering is some kind of a value-added \\ntax.\\n\\n\\t     Q\\t  But the President himself took this off the table, \\nDee Dee, and suddenly it reappears.  And this goes to the credibility \\nof this administration in a way.  What has happened in the meantime?\\n\\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  The President has not looked at this, it \\nhasn\\'t been presented to him, again, yet.  The working groups are \\nlooking at it, as they\\'re looking at a wide variety of options, and \\nno decisions have been made.\\n\\n\\t     Q\\t  And it raises the question of how independently the \\ntask force is working.\\n\\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  The task force was instructed to consider \\nall options, and they\\'ve taken that mandate seriously and they\\'re \\nconsidering all options.\\n\\n\\t     Q\\t  But that\\'s not the impression that the President \\nleft in February.  The impression he left was that this was something \\nthat was long-range, to be looked at 10, 15 years down the road.  The \\nclear implication of his remarks was that this was something that was \\nnot on the table, not an option. \\n\\n\\t     Q\\t  \"If it changes I\\'ll tell you.\"\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Bring him on.\\n\\n\\t     Q\\t  And you repeatedly referred to the President\\'s \\nremarks, telling us that those were still in operation.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  It\\'s changed, and we told you.  (Laughter.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  But that\\'s what Alice Rivlin\\'s comments and Donna \\nShalala comments were about.  I mean, that seemed like an \\norchestrated effort because you have two independent Cabinet officers \\n--\\n\\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I wouldn\\'t -- no, Alice Rivlin\\'s not a \\nCabinet member, first of all.  Second of all, it was not \\norchestrated, but clearly, they both said yesterday and in the last \\ncouple of days that it\\'s something that\\'s being looked at.  We \\nconfirmed that yesterday.  And I don\\'t have anything to add to that.\\n\\n\\t     Q\\t  Is it because he has very few options?\\n\\n\\t     Q\\t  Is this something that it will be incumbent upon \\nthe task force to convince the President about?  In other words, has \\nthe President himself personally ruled it out and it\\'s now up to the \\ntask force to convince him to put it back on the table?  Or is it, in \\nfact, back on the table, having been placed there by discussions with \\nthe President?  \\n\\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  It is not the working group\\'s mission at \\nthis point to convince the President of anything.  It is their \\nmission to put before him his options and to explain the benefits and \\nthe costs and the basic pros and cons of each of those options.  I \\nthink that they will certainly present the VAT to him in that \\ncontext, and at this point he\\'s not -- that presentation has not been \\nmade, but it\\'s something that he will hear and he has not made a \\ndecision on.\\n\\n\\t     Q\\t  They will present it to him as one of his options, \\nthough he specifically ruled it out?\\n\\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Correct.\\n\\n\\t     Q\\t  Dee Dee, is this more than a trial balloon?  Is \\nthis a serious consideration that the working groups are giving to \\nthis form of taxation?\\n\\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  It\\'s simply a statement of fact.  The \\nworking groups are considering a wide variety of options on a number \\nof issues relating to health care reform.  One of the options that \\nthey\\'re looking at is the VAT. \\n\\n\\t     Q\\t  Dee Dee, when the working groups were examining \\nthis possibility, was this on the table during the same time period \\nthat you were telling us that it was not?\\n\\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I don\\'t know what the specific timing of \\ntheir drafting of options is.  I don\\'t know.\\n\\n\\t     Q\\t  Who was telling you that it was not under \\nconsideration?\\n\\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I was referring back to the President\\'s \\ncomments.\\n\\n\\t     Q\\t  Have they discovered that the sin taxes won\\'t raise \\nenough money to fund the core benefit package?\\n\\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  No, there\\'s no decisions that have been made \\non how to pay for the health care plan.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  I\\'m asking whether the projections --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  There\\'s a number of options depending on how \\nthe plan is structured.  You can\\'t decide how much the plan is going \\nto cost until you decide what the plan is going to look like.  And so \\nyou can\\'t discuss what financing options have been ruled in our out \\nuntil you know.\\n\\n\\t     Q\\t  Dee Dee, we\\'ve been told that they have a computer \\nmodels on a number of possible packages.\\n\\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Correct.  \\n\\n\\t     Q\\t  The question is whether they have now determined \\nwhether sin taxes would not produce enough money for even the barest \\nminimum package.  That is not a very difficult computation.\\n\\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  It is a question that you know that we\\'re \\nnot going to answer until -- there\\'s a number of options being \\nconsidered.  It depends on how the package is structured.  The exact \\ndetails of the package and the financing mechanisms used to pay for \\nthem are all among the decisions that have yet to be made.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  And when the President has been meeting with health \\ncare -- his health care advisors, which we are told he has been doing \\n--\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Correct.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     they have never once said to him, these are your \\nfunding options, including the VAT?  He has never heard the word VAT \\nin his --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:    I am not going to comment on the specific \\nnature of the daily -- they\\'re not daily, but the quasi-regular \\nbriefings.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Well, you have.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I have not, other than to say that he\\'s not \\nconsidered the VAT.  And I think that is a true statement.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  No, but you said that it has not been presented to \\nhim as an option.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Correct.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  That doesn\\'t mean he hasn\\'t heard about it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I\\'m not going to get into the details of \\nwhat\\'s discussed.  I think that statement stands for itself.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     specific, Dee Dee.  When you say he hasn\\'t \\nlooked at it, do you mean that he hasn\\'t looked at it in terms of \\npaying for medical coverage, or hasn\\'t looked at it in general?  \\nBecause back in Chilicothe he was very specific in defining how it \\nworks, what the advantages are, the whole thing.  It sounds like --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  But that was -- I think in Chilicothe, if \\nyou go back to his remarks there, it was a broader philosophical \\ndiscussion of the tax structure.  And I think the comments were \\ngenerally in reference to the overall economic plan.  But clearly, \\nit\\'s something that he\\'s thought about in the broad context.  I mean, \\nthat was clear in Chilicothe.  What I\\'m saying is that in the process \\nof the working groups it\\'s something that he hasn\\'t considered yet.  \\nIt\\'s something that the working groups will present to him among the \\nnumber of options, and that no decisions have been made.  And I\\'m not \\ngoing to comment any further on the details of the meetings where \\nhealth care issues are being discussed.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  It\\'s your statement from this podium that no \\ndiscussion of this has taken place.  You say that no option -- that \\nthe option has not been presented to him.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  That is correct.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Do you stand by -- does the White House still stand \\nby George\\'s statement in March that this will not be in the proposal?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  No decisions have been made.  We have \\nnothing to add to what\\'s already been said.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Let me follow up here.  Do you stand by what Rivlin \\nsaid yesterday, that if any kind of VAT were to be used or \\nconsidered, that other changes to the tax code would have to be made \\nso that it would be less regressive?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I\\'m not going to comment any further on what \\nmight happen if.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  But do you stand by the previous conversations in \\nFebruary that if there were to be a VAT, I think the President said \\nyou\\'d exclude food and energy --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I\\'m not going to comment on the specific \\nstructure of a decision that hasn\\'t been made.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Was the President aware prior to Donna Shalala\\'s \\ncomments yesterday that this was under consideration by the working \\ngroups?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I don\\'t know specifically what --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Could you check for us, because that\\'s a real \\nimportant credibility question?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Sure.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Since the task force was brought together this \\nissue has been discussed, at the beginning and throughout, as one \\nfairly painless way to raise a lot of money.  Were you all kept in \\nthe dark?  Was the Press Office kept in the dark over the past month \\nand a half when you\\'ve been denying that a VAT tax would be \\nconsidered that it was actually on the table over there as an option?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I think we\\'ve said all that we have to say.  \\nIt is something the working groups are looking at.  The President has \\nnot made a decision about it yet.  And beyond that, I have nothing to \\nadd.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Well, sorry, Dee Dee, there are still a couple of \\nquestions that we are going to have to ask because we have a problem \\nwith credibility here -- yours primarily.  What we\\'re asking is, if \\nyou all were not told at all that this thing was being considered \\nwhile you were coming out here and telling us that it was not, or if \\nit\\'s a case that you were coming out here and deliberately misleading \\nus.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I don\\'t believe that anyone has ever come \\nout here and deliberately misled you from this podium -- ever --ever.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Has anyone tried to shade it a little bit to \\nindicate something -- has anybody told anybody to come out --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  We\\'re not trying to shade answers or \\ndeliberately mislead anybody.  I\\'ve said what I have to say about \\nthis issue.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  All we were trying to find out --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I understand what you\\'re trying to find out \\nand I\\'ve given you the answers, Helen.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  We\\'re trying to find out what changed -- what made \\nit an option again.  That\\'s the --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  The working groups were given a broad \\nmandate to investigate all options, and they are doing that.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Yes, but it wasn\\'t an option before.  How can you \\ninvestigate it if the President has taken it off the table?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  It is something that they\\'re obviously \\nconsidering and the President has not made a decision on.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Yes, but he took it off the table in February.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Working groups are considering it.  They\\'ll \\npresent it to the President at some point and he\\'ll make a decision.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Why would they consider it if he has taken it off \\nthe table?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  It\\'s clearly on the table. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Yes, but he took it off the table.  Did he change \\nhis mind?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  It\\'s back on the table, Bill.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Did he change his mind?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  He said this morning that he hasn\\'t made a \\ndecision about it.  He obviously knows that it\\'s on the table.  It\\'s \\nsomething that he will look at at some and when we have a decision on \\nthis we\\'ll let you know.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  So he must have changed his mind, right?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  At some point it will be looked at.  I mean, \\n--\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Dee Dee, there\\'s like two options -- either he \\nchanged his mind or the working groups think they\\'re authority \\nexceeds the President\\'s.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  The working groups were given a broad \\nmandate to look at all options; they\\'ve done that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Are you going to put out his income tax?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Yes, there will be something available on \\nhis income tax probably later this afternoon.  His return will be \\navailable. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Will there be any kind of briefing to go through \\nit?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  No, nothing\\'s planned.  I think someone will \\nbe available, probably not in a briefing setting, but to walk you \\nthrough the questions.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  We\\'re used to be walked line-by-line through the \\npresidential tax forms.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I\\'ve seen those briefings.  (Laughter.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Could we have one?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:   No, I don\\'t think there will be any kind of \\na formal briefing, but there will be somebody available to answer \\nyour questions about it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Did they file a joint form?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Yes.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  When did he file it?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I believe it\\'s being filed today.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Dee Dee, is there going to be a backgrounder for \\nMiyazawa?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  No, there will be a readout after the \\nmeeting.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  No backgrounder today?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  No backgrounder today.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  This is complicated stuff.  We need help.  \\n(Laughter.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  We can\\'t give you taxes and Miyazawa all in \\none day, it\\'s too confusing.  (Laughter.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Vance and Owen have opened the doors on the use of \\nforce in Bosnia.   They\\'ve both said that, A, they never ruled it \\nout, and B, it might be necessary now.  Does that influence your \\nthinking on whether or not to change your approach?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  There\\'s been no change in our policy towards \\nBosnia.  We have always said that we\\'d consider --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  But does that impact upon your decision?  Are they \\npeople whose opinions would carry weight with you?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  They\\'re people whose opinions carry weight \\ncertainly.  I mean, the President supports the process that they\\'ve \\ninitiated.  But there\\'s been no change in our policy for Bosnia, \\nalthough we\\'re considering a number of options right now.  If the \\nSerbs don\\'t come back to the negotiating table, if they don\\'t sign on \\nto some kind of an agreement, we will consider additional options, \\nwhich we\\'ve been saying regularly.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  One follow-up question then?  We cannot get a \\nstraight answer from anyone in the administration.  Why do you not \\nset a deadline for the Serbs?  Can you tell us the strategic or \\ntactical reasons for not giving them a deadline to come to the table?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  We\\'re continuing to put pressure on them \\nevery day.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Which doesn\\'t work so --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Well, we think it is having some effect.  \\nWe\\'re going to continue to tighten sanctions.  As you know, we \\nsupport the omnibus resolution.  We expect that to come to a vote on \\nthe 26th.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  You say it\\'s having an effect -- can you give us \\nany documentation?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I\\'d be happy to provide somebody to talk to \\nyou about the impact of the sanctions and things like that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  There\\'s been no -- you have not been able to \\nprovide anybody who can tell us that the sanctions have had any \\neffect in Bosnia.  Serbia, yes; in Bosnia, no.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I think that they\\'ve had effect in Serbia \\nand we think they\\'ve had some effect in Bosnia.  And again, I\\'ll be \\nhappy to provide somebody to walk you through the details of that, if \\nyou\\'d like.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  We would like to hear from someone who can show us \\nwhat the effect has been in Bosnia.  We had the briefing on all of \\nthe terrible things that are happening in Belgrade, but we haven\\'t \\nseen anything that indicates an impact on the fighting.  Can you \\nprovide something along those lines?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I will see what I can get you.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  On the extra Russian aid that Christopher announced \\nthis morning -- where is that money coming from?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  We\\'ll have to work with Congress on the \\ndetails of that package.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  So that would be new money that you would hope to \\nget?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:    Yes, that\\'s new money, in addition to the \\n$1.6 billion announced in Vancouver.  So I assume that you all have \\nseen the $1.8-billion package that was announced this morning in \\nTokyo by Secretary Christopher.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Isn\\'t there a concern, though, about offering \\nsomething which you have to get in Congress?  I mean, that was the \\nconcern with Vancouver; you didn\\'t want to do that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  The concern with Vancouver was to do \\nsomething immediately, which required money that was already approved \\nin the Fiscal \\'93 budget.  What we\\'re looking at now is a little bit \\nlonger-term plan to build on top of the $1.6 billion that we \\nannounced in Vancouver.  This clearly will require congressional \\napproval, or some of it will anyway, and we\\'re going to continue to \\nwork with Congress to make that happen.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  To what extent has that been vetted or agreed to by \\nCongress?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  The President has had a number of \\nconversations with members and will continue to work with them as \\nthis process moves forward.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Was Christopher able to put this package out with a \\nfair degree of understanding that you will be able to get it through \\nCongress?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  It was created in consultation with \\nCongress.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  In meeting with the law enforcement officials, is \\nthat -- does that have a set speech and a goal?  A direction?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Yes, the President will talk about -- and \\nthe law enforcement organizations are endorsing the President\\'s jobs \\npackage.  They believe particularly the summer jobs package will help \\ngive kids something to do.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Who are they?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  It\\'s members or leadership from three \\norganizations:  NAPO, which is the National Association of Police \\nOrganizations; IBPO, which is the International Brotherhood of Police \\nOrganizations, I believe; and IUPA, which is the International Union \\nof Police Associations.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Will the FBI chief be there?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  The FBI chief?  No.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Or any other federal law enforcement officials?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  No, it will be the President and these \\nnational law enforcement organization leaders.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Does the $1.8 billion announced today include the \\n$400 million that\\'s in the FY \\'94 budget for disarmament?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  No.  The Nunn-Lugar money is separate.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  So this would be the $700 million that\\'s in the \\nbudget already, plus another $1.1 billion?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I believe all of this is on top of the $700 \\nmillion already in the budget.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is this going to be part of the supplemental or \\nFiscal \\'94 --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  We\\'ll work with Congress on the exact \\nfunding mechanism -- on exactly how this will be paid for.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  This $1.8 billion on top of --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  On top of $700 million -- on top of the $400 \\nmillion Nunn-Lugar money we announced earlier.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  And this is what prompted the President to call Bob \\nDole -- it was on this tranche, not on the previous money he was \\ncalling Bob Dole?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Correct.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is there a briefing on Miyazawa?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  There will be a readout after the meeting \\nwith Miyazawa.  Tomorrow.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Dee Dee, on a totally unrelated matter, some \\nRepublicans who are active in the U.S. Chamber of Commerce are \\ncomplaining about this new cozy relationship between the White House \\nand the Chamber of Commerce.  There are -- the town hall meeting the \\nother night, the satellite and all of this relationship.\\nDoes the White House feel that you\\'re getting too close to these \\nChambers of Commerce?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  That\\'s an interesting charge.  (Laughter.)  \\nAfter how many years of Democrats being accused of not paying any \\nattention to the Chambers, now there are those who would accuse us of \\nbeing too close.  I think that\\'s interesting.  But no, we\\'re thrilled \\nby the support we\\'ve received from the national Chamber and local \\nChambers across the country and we\\'ll continue to work with them on \\nthis and other initiatives.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What\\'s the status of the President thinking about \\ngoing to this Democratic retreat?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  It\\'s on his calendar.  I think he\\'ll almost \\ncertainly go.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  All three days?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  We haven\\'t figured out exactly when he\\'ll be \\nthere yet.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is it open to coverage?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS.

Critz, III (CIS ID# 71611,365), of Peoria, Illinois.\\nEnviroLeague exists for the education of youth, both male and female, in\\nmatters concerning their values related to and responsibility for our\\nenvironment.\\n \\nIncorporated as an Illinois not-for-profit corporation, its Articles and\\ninitial applications for a service mark have now been filed.  According to\\nCritz, its draft Bylaws contain the following statement of Mission and\\nObjectives:\\n \\n                           MISSION\\n \\n   It is the Mission of EnviroLeague and its adult members\\n   to foster and implement the improved education of young\\n   people in the need to conduct their lives as Stewards\\n   of The Earth, to leave The Earth in a better condition\\n   than they found it, and to otherwise act as responsible,\\n   moral and ethical users of their environment.  To pursue\\n   the accomplishment of this Mission, EnviroLeague shall\\n   seek to serve as a catalyst, focusing in common cause the\\n   separate efforts of all groups desiring the preservation,\\n   improvement, and responsible use of the environment in\\n   which we must all live.\\n \\n                         OBJECTIVES\\n \\n   In pursuit of the Mission of EnviroLeague, its primary\\n   objectives shall be:\\n       (1)  To establish a Movement involving as many\\n            environmentally concerned organizations as\\n            possible, said Movement having as its primary\\n            focus the education and participatory\\n            involvement of young people in appropriate areas\\n            of environmental concern;\\n       (2)  To develop and provide to such organizations and\\n            their branches a full complement of program\\n            materials for their use, including suitable\\n            uniforms, insignia and other badges, written\\n            ideas, syllabi and information, literature and\\n            other items as shall seem appropriate and\\n            desirable;\\n       (3)  To serve as a \"clearing house\" for the exchange\\n            of program ideas, materials and information\\n            among said organizations;  and\\n       (4)  To assist environmentally concerned\\n            organizations to recruit and train the necessary\\n            adult leadership for their youth programs.\\n \\nEnviroLeague will operate through three \"Program Divisions\" serving youth in\\nthe elementary, middle and high school grades, respectively.  Service shall be\\nthrough formation of \"EnviroLeague Teams,\" either by EnviroLeague itself or by\\nenvironmentally conscious organizations (or their local branches) wishing a\\ncharter to use programs developed by EnviroLeague.\\n \\nEnviroLeague, as it develops, will be controlled by the actual adult leaders\\nof each local Team, and will have no nationally imposed obstacles to\\nmembership or adult leadership status not based upon relevant improper\\nconduct. Organizations accepting a charter may, however, impose certain\\nadditional standards for their own use of the program material.  Should such\\norganizations do so, EnviroLeague will commit itself to forming, as soon as\\npossible, new nearby Teams having no such restrictions, particularly as to\\nyouth membership.\\n \\nEnviroLeague will operate on the principle that youth will have much to\\ncontribute to developing its programs.  Thus, the top youth leaders of its\\nTeams for middle and high school youth may become involved in governing any\\nlocal administrative groups, and those for its high school youth may be\\ninvolved in similar functions at the national level.\\n \\nProgram materials are in development at this time.  Copies of the \"draft\"\\nportions of the Mentor\\'s Manual (manual for adult leadership) will be in the\\nEARTH Forum, Library 17. These files will be updated as development takes\\nplace.\\n \\nCompuServe is particularly proud that EnviroLeague\\'s founder chose this\\nelectronic medium to make the first public announcement of its formation.\\nThis announcement is being made simultaneously in both the OUTDOOR and EARTH\\nForums.\\n \\nThe electronic home of EnviroLeague is in CompuServe\\'s Earth Forum - GO\\nEARTH - message and library areas 17, both named \"EnviroLeague.\"\\n============================================================================\\n \\nSubsequently, EnviroLeague\\'s Initial Governance Council has held its first\\nmeeting.  Boyd Critz was elected as the first EnviroLeague Chief Guardian\\n(equivalent to Chairman of the Board or CEO).  He can be reached at home\\n(309) 675-4483 in case of real need.

For sanity\\'s sake we must assume, if we believe in Him at all,\\nthat His message comes through somehow.  The question is whether it comes \\nthrough immediately to every individual, or is contained in a complex \\ncanon that must be interpreted by experts in consultation with one another, \\nor is transmitted directly through appointed representatives who are free\\nto interpret, extend and modify the canon.  If God\\'s message is indeed\\nmediated, the further problem arises as to whether the individual under-\\nstands the mediated message fully and clearly.  Since the responsibility \\nfor understanding lies ultimately with the individual, we must assume that \\nGod in His benevolence guides each individual to the appropriate source \\nfor that individual, whereof the person may or may not drink. \\n \\n \\n \\nYour example is complicated in our age by the thin line between morality\\nand politeness.  You might have said \"burp\", for burping and swearing carry\\nabout the same stigma today.  If you are talking about \"taking the Lord\\'s \\nname in vain\" as a serious transgression, then this example is more a case of \\nhypocrisy than of varying moral codes.\\n \\nIf there is an absolute moral code, propositions or laws in that code apply\\nabsolutely and universally, by definition.  Conceivably some moral codes\\ncould be subsets of the universal code, as you say at the outset.  So, for\\nexample, God\\'s code could include, \"Thou shalt not create Beings without\\na hospitable planet to live on\", but this law would be inapplicable to us.\\nNevertheless, we would be entitled to suppose that all laws applicable\\nto us are also applicable to God.\\n \\nBut when you begin to ask what laws might appear in God\\'s moral code, you have\\na sense of the absurdity of the question.  Does God make laws for Himself to\\nfollow?  Perhaps God is not the sort of being to which the category \"morality\"\\ncan be sensibly applied.',\n  'Hi,\\nI got a glimpse from the other side, talking to the technician at the\\nplace I recently bought my Mac from.

If they are\\nalso extroverted, they are best described as \"Field Marshalls\".  This trait\\nis very valuable and essential in our society - we need people who want to\\nlead, to strive to overcome the elements, to seek and thirst for knowledge,\\nto raise the level of competency, etc.  The great successes in science and\\ntechnology are in large part due to the vision (an N trait) and scientifically-\\nminded approach (T trait) of the NT personality (of course, the other types\\nand temperaments have their own positive contributions as well).  However,\\nwhen the NT person has self-image challenges, the \"dark-side\" of this\\npersonality type usually comes out, which should be obvious to all.\\n\\nA physician who is a strong NT and who has not learned to temper their\\ntemperament will be extremely business-like (lack of empathy or feeling),\\nand is very compelled to have total control over their patient (the patient\\nmust be obedient to their diagnosis and prescription without question).

Of course, I believe that I have\\nbeen misdiagnosed on the net as suffering from \\'anal retentivitis\\', but being\\nthe phlegmatic I am, maybe I was just a little too harsh on a few people\\nmyself in past posts.  Let\\'s all try to raise the level of this discussion\\nabove the level of anal effluent.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn my well-described situation (in prior posts), I definitely was immune\\nstressed.  Blood tests showed my vitamin A levels were very low.  My sinuses\\nwere a mess - no doubt the mucosal lining and the cilia were heavily damaged.\\nI also was on antibiotics 15 times in 4 years!  In the end, even two weeks\\nof Ceftin did not work and I had confirmed diagnoses of a chronic bacterial\\ninfection of the sinuses via cat-scans, mucus color (won\\'t get into the\\ndetails), and other symptoms.  Three very traditional ENT\\'s made this\\ndiagnosis (I did not have any cultures done, however, because of the\\ndifficulty of doing this right and because my other symptoms clearly showed\\na bacterial infection).  Enough of this background (provided to help you\\nunderstand where I was when I make comments about my Sporanox anti-fungal\\ntherapy below).\\n\\n\\nThe first question I have is this.  Can fungus penetrate a little way into poor\\nmucus membrane tissue, maybe via hyphae, thus causing symptoms, without being\\nconsidered \\'systemic\\' in the classic sense?  It is sort of an inbetween\\ninfection.\\n\\n\\n\\nI was concerned, too, because of the toxicity of vitamin A.  My doctor, after\\nmy blood tests, put me on 75,000 IU of vitamin A for one week only, then\\ndropped it down to 25,000 IU for the next couple of weeks.  I also received\\nzinc and other supplementation, since all of these interrelate in fairly\\ncomplex ways as my doctor explained (he\\'s one of those \\'evil\\' orthomolecular\\nspecialists).  I had a blood test three weeks later and vitamin A was normal,\\nhe then stopped me on all vitamin A (except for some in a multi-vitamin)\\nsupplement), and made sure that I maintain a 50,000 IU/day of beta carotene.\\nCall me carrot face.  :^)\\n\\nHopefully, Elaine\\'s doctor will take a similar, careful approach and to\\nall supplements.  I\\'m even reevaluating some supplements I\\'m taking, for\\nexample, niacin in fairly large dosages, 1 gram/day, which Steve Dyer had\\ngood information about on sci.med.nutrition.  If niacin only has second-order\\nimprovement in symptomatic relief of my sinus allergies, then it probably is\\nnot worth taking such a large dose long-term and risking liver damage.\\n\\n\\n\\nThough I do now believe, based on my successful therapy with Sporanox, that\\nI definitely had some excessive growth of fungus (unknown species) in my\\nsinuses, I still want to ask the question:  have there been any studies that\\ndemonstrate candida \"blooms\" in the sinuses with associated sinus irritation\\n(sinusitis/rhinitis)?  (My sinus irritation reduced significantly after one\\nweek of Sporanox and no other new treatments were implemented during this\\ntime - I did not have any noticeable GI track problems before starting on\\nSporanox, but some for a few days after which then went away - considered\\nnormal).\\n\\nBTW, my doctor dug out one of his medical reference books (sorry, can\\'t\\nremember which one), and found an obscure comment dating back into the 1950\\'s\\nwhich stated that people can develop contained (non-lethal or non-serious)\\naspergillis infestations (aspergiliosis) of the sinuses leading to sinus\\ninflammation symptoms.  I\\'ll have to dig out that reference again since it\\nis relevant to this discussion.\\n\\n\\n\\nMy doctor tested me (I believe a RAST or RAST similar test) for allergic\\nresponse to specificially Candida albicans, and I showed a strong positive.\\nAnother question, would everybody show the same strong positive so this test\\nis essentially useless?  And, assuming it is true that Candida can grow\\npart-way into the mucus membrane tissue, and the concentration exceeds a \\nthreshold amount, could not a person who tests as having an allergy to\\nCandida definitely develop allergic symptoms, such as mucus membrane\\nirritation due to the body\\'s allergic response?  As I said in an earlier post,\\none does not need to be a rocket scientist, or have a M.D. degree or a \\nPh.D. in biochemistry to see the plausibility of this hypothesis.\\n\\nBTW, and I\\'ll repost this again.  Dr. Ivker, in his book, \"Sinus Survival\",\\nhas routinely given, before anything else, Nizoral (a pre-Sporanox systemic\\nanti-fungal, not as safe and not as good as Sporanox) to his new chronic\\nsinusitis patients IF they have been on antibiotics four or more times in\\nthe last two years.  He claims that out of 2000 or so patients, well over\\n90% notice some relief of sinus inflammation and other symptoms, but it\\ndoesn\\'t cure it by any means, implying the so-called yeast/fungus infection\\nis not the primary cause, but a later complication.  He\\'s also found that\\nnystatin, whether taken internally, or put into a sinus spray, does not help.\\n\\nThis implies (of course assuming that excessive yeast/fungus bloom is\\naggravating the sinus inflammation) that the yeast/fungus has grown partway\\ninto the tissue since nystatin will not kill yeast/fungus other than by\\ndirect contact - it is not absorbed into the blood stream.  Again, I admit,\\nlots of \\'ifs\\', and \\'implies\\', which doesn\\'t please the hard-core NT who\\nhas to have the double-blind study or it\\'s a non-issue, but one has to start\\nwith some plausible hypothesis/explanation, a strawman, if you will.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis brings up an interesting observation used by those who will deny\\nand reject any and all aspects of the \\'yeast hypothesis\\' until the\\nappropriate studies are done.  And that is if you can\\'t observe or culture\\nthe yeast \"bloom\" in the gut or sinus, then there\\'s no way to diagnose or\\neven recognize the disease.  And I know they realize that it is virtually\\nimpossible to test for candida overbloom in any part of the body that cannot\\nbe easily observed since candida is everywhere in the body.\\n\\nIt\\'s a real Catch-22.\\n\\nAnother Catch-22:  Those who totally reject the \\'yeast hypothesis\\' say that\\nno studies have been done (actually studies have been done, but if it\\'s not\\nup to a certain standard then it is, from their perspective, a non-study which\\nshould not even be considered).  I agree that the appropriate studies should\\nbe done, and that will take big $ to do it right.  However, in order to\\nconvince the funding agencies in these austere times to open their wallets,\\nyou literally have to give them evidence, and the only acceptable evidence to\\ncompete with other proposals is paradoxically to do almost the exact study\\nneeded funding.  That is, you have to do 90% of the study before you even get\\nfunding (as a scientist at a National Lab, I\\'m very aware of this for the\\nsmaller funded projects).  I\\'m afraid that even if Dr. Ivker and 100 other\\ndoctors got together, pooled their practice\\'s case histories and anecdotes\\ninto a compelling picture, and approach the funding agencies, they would get\\nnowhere, even if they were able to publish their statistical results.\\n\\nIt is obvious from the comments by some of the doctors here is that they have\\n*decided* excessive yeast colonization in the gut or sinuses leading to\\nnoticeable non-lethal symptoms does not exist, and is not even a tenable\\nhypothesis, so any amount of case histories or compiled anecdotal evidence\\nto the contrary will never change their mind, and not only that, they would\\nalso oppose the needed studies because in their minds it\\'s a done issue - \\nexcessive yeast growth leading to diffuse allergic symptoms does not, will\\nnot, and cannot exist.  Period.  Kind of tough to dialog with those who hold\\nsuch a viewpoint.  Kind of reminds me of Lister...\\n\\n\\n\\nAren\\'t there also other nutrients necessary to the proper working of the\\nsinus mucus membranes and cilia?\\n\\n\\n\\nAgain, the evidence from mycological studies indicate that many yeast/fungus\\nspecies can grow hyphae (\"roots\") into deep tissue, similar to mold growing\\nin bread.  You can continue to kill the surface, such as nystatin does, but\\nyou can\\'t kill that which is deeper in the tissue without using a systemic\\nanti-fungal such as itraconazole (Sporanox) or some of the older ones such\\nas Nizoral which are more toxic and not as effective.  This is why, as has\\nbeen pointed out by recent studies (sent to me by a doctor I\\'ve been in\\ne-mail contact with - thanks), that nystatin is not effective in the long-\\nterm treatment of GI tract \"candidiasis\".  It\\'s like trying to weed a garden\\nby cutting off what\\'s above the ground but leaving the roots ready to come\\nout again once you walk away.\\n\\nThe $60000 question is whether a contained candida \"bloom\" can partially\\ngrow into tissue through the mucus membranes, causing some types of symptoms\\nin susceptible people (e.g., allergy), without becoming \"systemic\" in the\\nclassical sense of the word - something in between strictly an excessive\\nbloom not causing any problems and the full-blown systemic infection that\\nis potentially lethal.\\n\\n\\n\\nAlso, if one is an \\'anal retentive\\', like I\\'ve been diagnosed in a prior\\npost, that can also provide more sites for excessive candida growth.  ;^)\\n\\n\\n\\nAs I\\'ve said in private e-mail, there are flaws in our current medical system\\nthat make it difficult or even impossible for a physician to attempt\\nalternative therapies AFTER the approved/proven/accepted therapies don\\'t work.\\nFor example, I went to three ENT\\'s, who all said that I will just have to live\\nwith my acute/chronic sinusitis after the ab\\'s failed (they did mention\\nsurgery to open up the ostia, but my ostia weren\\'t plugged and it would not\\nget to the root cause of my condition).  After three months of aggressive and\\nfairly non-standard therapy (Sporanox, body nutrient level monitoring and\\nequalization, vitamin C, lentinen, echinacea, etc.), my health has vastly\\nimproved to where I was two years ago, before my health greatly deteriorated.\\nOf course, skeptics would say that maybe if I did nothing I would have\\nimproved anyway, but that view is stretching things quite far because of the\\nexperience of the three ENT\\'s I saw who said that I\\'d just have to \"live with\\nit\".  I\\'m confident I will reach what one could call a total \"cure\".  The\\nanti-fungal program I undertook was one necessary step in that direction\\nbecause of my overuse of ab\\'s for the last four years.  (Note:  for those\\nhaving sinus problems, may I suggest the book by Dr. Ivker I mention above.\\nBe sure to get the revised edition.)\\n\\n\\n\\nDr. Ivker started off having chronic and severe sinus problems, and his\\nvisits to several ENT\\'s totally floored him when they said \"you\\'ll just have\\nto live with it\".  He spent several years trying everything - standard and\\nnon-standard, until he was essentially cured of chronic sinusitis.  He now\\nshares his approach in his book and I can honestly say that I am on the road\\nto recovery following some parts of it.  His one recommendation to take a\\nsystemic anti-fungal at the beginning of treatment IF you have a history of\\nanti-biotic overuse has been proven to him time and time again in his own\\npractice.  I\\'m sure if I commented to him of the hard-core beliefs of the anti-\\n\"yeast hypothesis\" posters that he would have definite things to say, such as,\\n\"it\\'s worked wonders for me in almost two thousand cases\", to put it mildly.\\nI also would not be surprised if he would say that they are the ones violating\\ntheir moral obligations to help the patient.\\n\\nMaybe those doctors who are reading this who have a practice and are\\nconfronted by a patient having symptoms that could be due to the \"hypothetical\\nyeast overgrowth\" (e.g., they fit some of the profiles the pro-yeast people\\nhave identified), should consider anti-fungal therapy IF all other avenues\\nhave been exhausted.  Remember, theory and practice are two different things -\\nyou cannot have one without the other, they are synergistic.  If a doctor does\\nsomething non-standard yet produces noticeable symptomatic relief in over a\\nthousand of his patients, shouldn\\'t you at least sit up and take notice?\\nMaybe you ought to trust what he says and begin hypothesizing why it works\\ninstead of why it shouldn\\'t work.  I\\'m afraid a lot of doctors have become\\nso enamored with \"scientific correctness\" that they are ignoring the patients\\nthey have sworn to help.  You have to do both;  both have to be balanced, which\\nwe don\\'t see from some of the posters to this group.  There comes a point when\\nyou just have to use a little common sense, and maybe an empirical approach\\n(such as trying a good systemic anti-fungal such as Sporanox) after having\\nexhausted all the other avenues.  I was one of those who the traditional\\nmedical establishment was not able to help, so I did the natural thing:  I\\nwent to a couple of doctor\\'s who are (somewhat) outside this establishment,\\nand as a result I have found significant relief.\\n\\nWould it not be better if the traditional medical establishment can set up\\nsome kind of mechanism where any doctor, without fear of being sued or having\\nhis license pulled, can try experimental and unproven (beyond a doubt)\\ntherapies for his/her patients that finally reach the point where all the\\naccepted therapies are ineffective?  I\\'d like to hear a doctor tell me:\\n\"well, I\\'ve tried all the therapies that are approved and accepted in this\\ncountry, and since they clearly don\\'t work for you, I now have the authority\\nto use experimental, unproven techniques that seem to have helped others.  I\\ncan\\'t promise anything, and there are some risks.  You will have to sign\\nsomething saying you understand the experimental and possibly risky nature of\\nthese unproven therapies, and I\\'ll have to register your case at the State\\nBoard.\"  Anyway, if my ENT had suggested this to me, I would\\'ve jumped on this\\npronto instead of going to one of those doctors who, for either altruistic\\nreasons, or for greed, is practicing these alternative therapies with much\\nrisk to him/her (risk meaning losing their license) and possibly to the\\npatient.  Such a mechanism would keep control in the more mainstream medicine,\\nand also provide valuable data that would essentially be free.  It also would\\nbe morally and ethically better than the current system by showing the\\ncompassion of the medical community to the patient - that it\\'s doing everything\\nit can within reason to help the patient.  It is the lack of such a mechanism\\nthat is leading large numbers of people to try alternative therapies, some of\\nwhich seem to work (like my case), and others of which will never work at all\\n(true quackery).\\n\\nI better get off my soapbox before this post reaches 500K in size.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat dosage of B6 appears to be necessary to promote the healing and proper\\nworking of the mucos memebranes?\\n\\n\\n\\nI\\'d like to see the role of complex carbohydrates, such as starch.\\n\\n\\n\\nBrave soul you are.

I explained it, but left justification\\nup to our Catholic readers.  --clh]\\n\\nThere is no direct reference in the Holy Scripture except for the\\nmention of Mary\\'s _blessedness_/full of grace in the \"Annunciation\" by\\nAngel Gabriel in Luke 1:26-28\\n\\n And in the 6th month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto\\n a city of Galilee, named Nazareth.  To a virgin espoused to a\\n man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin\\'s\\n name was Mary.  And the angel came unto her and said, _\"Hail,\\n thou that art highly favoured, the Lord is with thee: blessed\\n art thou among women.\"_\\n\\nNow, now, hold that line of thought - \"the Lord is with Mary &\\nblessed art thou among women\" - while you read on....\\n\\nIn the book, \"First Lady of the World, A Popular History of\\nDevotion to Mary\" by Peter Lappin:\\n\\nThe _Immaculate Conception_ matter is really far more complicated\\nthan the _Assumption_.  This arose in 430 AD.  It is quite possible\\nthat the feast of _Mary\\'s Conception_ under the title \"The Conception\\nof Saint Anne\", originally commemorated the _physical miracle_ of\\na woman _beyond the age_ of child bearing, conceiving a daughter,\\njust as Elizabeth had conceived John the Baptist.  A transfer in\\nemphasis from the physical miracle wrought in Anne to the miracle\\nof grace wrought by God in the soul of Mary was _logical_.  Mary\\nis the incorruptible timber \"out of which was hewn the _tabernacle_\\nof Christ\\'s sinless body\"; she is \"God\\'s Eden, in whom there is\\nno tree of knowledge, and no serpent that harms.\"  Her perfect\\nbeauty and spotlessness find their exemplar in Christ, her\\npurity in that of the Father.  At the time of the Council of Ephesus,\\nshe was hailed as \"innocent, without blemish, immaculate, inviolate,\\nspotless, holy in soul and body, who was blessed as a lily from\\namong thorns, unlearned in the evil ways of Eve\".\\n...\\nAt the end of the thirteenth century, an Irish Franciscan,\\nJohn Duns Scotus (1266-1308),...God maintained that it was a \\ngreater thing for Him to preserve His (the Son) mother from all\\nsin _than to use His power to clease her from it later_.\\n...\\n\\nNow let\\'s go to the discussion of baptism and original sin.\\nFrom \"Pocket Catholic Cathechism\" by John A. Hardon:\\n\\nBaptism -\\nConcupiscence Remains after Baptism.\\nConcupiscence or the tendency to sin remains in the baptized\\nbut since it is left to provide trial, it has no power to\\ninjure those who do not consent and who by the grace of\\nChrist Jesus, manfully resist (Canon 5).\\n\\nOriginal gifts of Adam and Eve before their fall:\\nIn the light of the foregoing, we see that our first\\nparents were originally gifted three times over:\\n-They had the natural gifts of human beings especially the\\n power to think and to choose freely.\\n-The had the _preternatural_ gifts of bodily immortality\\n and of integrity, or the internal power to control desires.\\n-They had the _supernatural_ gifts of sanctifying grace,\\n the virtues of faith, hope, and charity and the corresponding\\n title to enter heaven.\\nBy their disobedience, they lost the _supernatural and\\npreternatural_ gifts entirely, and were weakened (without\\nlosing) their natural capacity to reason and to choose\\nfreely.\\n\\nBaptism restores the _supernatural_ life lost by Adam\\'s\\nsin.  It _does not_ restore the _preternatural_ gifts\\nbut gifts as a title to a glorified restoration of our\\nbodies on the last day...\\n\\nGoing back to _Immaculate Conception_\\n(I am not sure if this interpretation is in any other\\nbooks but it may be another contribution to the \\'puzzle\\'):\\n\\nGiven the miracle of St. Anne bearing a child at a\\nnon-childbearing age, AND Christ was not yet born \\nAND _there was no baptism yet_ on Mary\\'s birth but\\nSTILL, the Angel Gabriel\\'s greetings was:\\n\"Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with you.\\nBlessed art thou amongst women\".\\n\\nEven Mary was confused about this greeting.\\n\\nMary could very well have possessed all of the\\n_treefold original gifts above_ given to our first\\nparents (Adam and Eve before their sin):\\n    Hail Mary (Example of praise given by the Angel Gabriel)\\n    Full of grace (natural, preternatural, supernatural)\\n    The Lord is with you (At those times, God would\\n                definitely want to be with those He\\n                has made _blessed_)\\n    Blessed art thou amongst women (that says it all)\\n\\nAt the conception, God made Mary _full of grace\\nand blessed_ as the \\'tabernacle\\' for the coming body\\nof Christ and so,\\n\\nImmaculate Conception of Mary is true and Mary still\\nhas maintained her Immaculate Heart.

Rather than use technology to accommodate\\n   the sometimes competing interests of economic growth, privacy and\\n   law enforcement, previous policies have pitted government against\\n   industry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement.\\n\\n   Sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to\\n   protect electronic funds transfer.  It is now being used to\\n   protect electronic mail and computer files.  While encryption\\n   technology can help Americans protect business secrets and the\\n   unauthorized release of personal information, it also can be used\\n   by terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.\\n\\n   A state-of-the-art microcircuit called the \"Clipper Chip\" has\\n   been developed by government engineers.  The chip represents a\\n   new approach to encryption technology.  It can be used in new,\\n   relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to\\n   an ordinary telephone.  It scrambles telephone communications\\n   using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in\\n   commercial use today.\\n\\n   This new technology will help companies protect proprietary\\n   information, protect the privacy of personal phone conversations\\n   and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted\\n   electronically.  At the same time this technology preserves the\\n   ability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to\\n   intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals. \\n\\n   A \"key-escrow\" system will be established to ensure that the\\n   \"Clipper Chip\" is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding\\n   Americans.  Each device containing the chip will have two unique\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t   2\\n\\n\\n   \"keys,\" numbers that will be needed by authorized government\\n   agencies to decode messages encoded by the device.  When the\\n   device is manufactured, the two keys will be deposited separately\\n   in two \"key-escrow\" data bases that will be established by the\\n   Attorney General.  Access to these keys will be limited to\\n   government officials with legal authorization to conduct a\\n   wiretap.\\n\\n   The \"Clipper Chip\" technology provides law enforcement with no\\n   new authorities to access the content of the private\\n   conversations of Americans.\\n\\n   To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, the\\n   Attorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new\\n   devices.  In addition, respected experts from outside the\\n   government will be offered access to the confidential details of\\n   the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report\\n   their findings.\\n\\n   The chip is an important step in addressing the problem of\\n   encryption\\'s dual-edge sword:  encryption helps to protect the\\n   privacy of individuals and industry, but it also can shield\\n   criminals and terrorists.  We need the \"Clipper Chip\" and other\\n   approaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with access\\n   to the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it\\n   to hide their illegal activities.  In order to assess technology\\n   trends and explore new approaches (like the key-escrow system),\\n   the President has directed government agencies to develop a\\n   comprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates:\\n\\n\\t--   the privacy of our citizens, including the need to\\n\\t     employ voice or data encryption for business purposes;\\n\\n\\t--   the ability of authorized officials to access telephone\\n\\t     calls and data, under proper court or other legal\\n\\t     order, when necessary to protect our citizens;\\n\\n\\t--   the effective and timely use of the most modern\\n\\t     technology to build the National Information\\n\\t     Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and\\n\\t     the competitiveness of American industry in the global\\n\\t     marketplace; and \\n\\n\\t--   the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export\\n\\t     high technology products.\\n\\n   The President has directed early and frequent consultations with\\n   affected industries, the Congress and groups that advocate the\\n   privacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t   3\\n\\n   The Administration is committed to working with the private\\n   sector to spur the development of a National Information\\n   Infrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer\\n   technologies to give Americans unprecedented access to\\n   information.  This infrastructure of high-speed networks\\n   (\"information superhighways\") will transmit video, images, HDTV\\n   programming, and huge data files as easily as today\\'s telephone\\n   system transmits voice.\\n\\n   Since encryption technology will play an increasingly important\\n   role in that infrastructure, the Federal Government must act\\n   quickly to develop consistent, comprehensive policies regarding\\n   its use.  The Administration is committed to policies that\\n   protect all Americans\\' right to privacy while also protecting\\n   them from those who break the law.\\n\\n   Further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet. \\n   The provisions of the President\\'s directive to acquire the new\\n   encryption technology are also available.  \\n\\n   For additional details, call Mat Heyman, National Institute of\\n   Standards and Technology, (301) 975-2758.\\n\\n   ---------------------------------\\n\\n\\n   QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION\\'S\\n   TELECOMMUNICATIONS INITIATIVE\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Q:   Does this approach expand the authority of government\\n\\tagencies to listen in on phone conversations?\\n\\n   A:   No.  \"Clipper Chip\" technology provides law enforcement with\\n\\tno new authorities to access the content of the private\\n\\tconversations of Americans.\\n\\n   Q:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on\\n\\ta drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation\\n\\tencrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to\\n\\tdecipher the message?\\n\\n   A:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a\\n\\tcourt order, to do the wiretap in the first place.  They\\n\\twould then present documentation of this authorization to\\n\\tthe two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and\\n\\tobtain the keys for the device being used by the drug\\n\\tsmugglers.  The key is split into two parts, which are\\n\\tstored separately in order to ensure the security of the key\\n\\tescrow system.\\n\\n   Q:   Who will run the key-escrow data banks?\\n\\n   A:   The two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent\\n\\tentities.  At this point, the Department of Justice and the\\n\\tAdministration have yet to determine which agencies will\\n\\toversee the key-escrow data banks.\\n\\n   Q:   How strong is the security in the device?  How can I be sure\\n\\thow strong the security is?  \\n\\n   A:   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption\\n\\tsystems readily available today.  While the algorithm will\\n\\tremain classified to protect the security of the key escrow\\n\\tsystem, we are willing to invite an independent panel of\\n\\tcryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all\\n\\tpotential users that there are no unrecognized\\n\\tvulnerabilities.\\n\\n   Q:   Whose decision was it to propose this product?\\n\\n   A:   The National Security Council, the Justice Department, the\\n\\tCommerce Department, and other key agencies were involved in\\n\\tthis decision.  This approach has been endorsed by the\\n\\tPresident, the Vice President, and appropriate Cabinet\\n\\tofficials.\\n\\n   Q:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry?\\n\\n   A:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on\\n\\tencryption issues, and expect those discussions to intensify\\n\\tas we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have\\n\\tbriefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the\\n\\tdecisions related to this initiative.\\n\\n   Q:   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers?\\n\\n   A:   The government designed and developed the key access\\n\\tencryption microcircuits, but it is not providing the\\n\\tmicrocircuits to product manufacturers.  Product\\n\\tmanufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip\\n\\tmanufacturer that produces them.\\n\\n   Q:   Who provides the \"Clipper Chip\"?\\n\\n   A:   Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance,\\n\\tCalifornia, and will sell the chip to encryption device\\n\\tmanufacturers.  The programming function could be licensed\\n\\tto other vendors in the future.\\n\\n   Q:   How do I buy one of these encryption devices? \\n\\n   A:   We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating\\n\\tthe \"Clipper Chip\" into their devices.\\n\\n   Q:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological\\n\\tsolution like the one proposed, would the Administration be\\n\\twilling to use legal remedies to restrict access to more\\n\\tpowerful encryption devices?\\n\\n   A:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be\\n\\tconsidered during the broad policy review.  The key escrow\\n\\tmechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product\\n\\tthat is more secure, more convenient, and less expensive\\n\\tthan others readily available today, but it is just one\\n\\tpiece of what must be the comprehensive approach to\\n\\tencryption technology, which the Administration is\\n\\tdeveloping.\\n\\n\\tThe Administration is not saying, \"since encryption\\n\\tthreatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,\\n\\twe will prohibit it outright\" (as some countries have\\n\\teffectively done); nor is the U.S. saying that \"every\\n\\tAmerican, as a matter of right, is entitled to an\\n\\tunbreakable commercial encryption product.\"  There is a\\n\\tfalse \"tension\" created in the assessment that this issue is\\n\\tan \"either-or\" proposition.  Rather, both concerns can be,\\n\\tand in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned,\\n\\tbalanced approach such as is proposed with the \"Clipper\\n\\tChip\" and similar encryption techniques.\\n\\n   Q:   What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton\\n\\tAdministration\\'s policy toward encryption will differ from\\n\\tthat of the Bush Administration?  \\n\\n   A:   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption\\n\\ttechnology in telecommunications and computing and are\\n\\tcommitted to working with industry and public-interest\\n\\tgroups to find innovative ways to protect Americans\\'\\n\\tprivacy, help businesses to compete, and ensure that law\\n\\tenforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime\\n\\tand terrorism.\\n\\n   Q:   Will the devices be exportable?

If you have corrections or answers to other frequently asked\\nquestions that you would like included in this posting, send email to\\nleech@cs.unc.edu (Jon Leech).\\n\\n    If you don\\'t want to see the FAQ, add \\'Frequently Asked Questions\\' to\\nyour KILL file for this group (if you\\'re not reading this with a newsreader\\nthat can kill articles by subject, you\\'re out of luck).\\n\\n    The FAQ volume is excessive right now and will hopefully be trimmed down\\nby rewriting and condensing over time. The FAQ postings are available in\\nthe Ames SPACE archive in FAQ/faq&lt;#&gt;.\\n\\n    Good summaries will be accepted in place of the answers given here. The\\npoint of this is to circulate existing information, and avoid rehashing old\\nanswers. Better to build on top than start again. Nothing more depressing\\nthan rehashing old topics for the 100th time. References are provided\\nbecause they give more complete information than any short generalization.\\n\\n    Questions fall into three basic types:\\n\\n    1) Where do I find some information about space?\\n\\n    Try your local public library first. The net is not a good place to ask\\n    for general information. Ask INDIVIDUALS (by email) if you must. There\\n    are other sources, use them, too. The net is a place for open ended\\n    discussion.\\n\\n    2) I have an idea which would improve space flight?\\n\\n    Hope you aren\\'t surprised, but 9,999 out of 10,000 have usually been\\n    thought of before. Again, contact a direct individual source for\\n    evaluation. NASA fields thousands of these each day.\\n\\n    3) Miscellanous queries.\\n\\n    These are addressed on a case-by-case basis in the following series of\\n    FAQ postings.\\n\\n\\n    SUGGESTIONS FOR BETTER NETIQUETTE\\n\\n    Read news.announce.newusers if you\\'re on Usenet.\\n    Minimize cross references, [Do you REALLY NEED to?]\\n    Edit \"Subject:\" lines, especially if you\\'re taking a tangent.\\n    Send mail instead, avoid posting follow ups.

EDT\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  On February the 28th, four federal\\nagents were killed in the line of duty trying to enforce the law\\nagainst the Branch Davidian compound, which had illegally stockpiled\\nweaponry and ammunition, and placed innocent children at risk.\\nBecause the BATF operation had failed to meet its objective, a 51-day\\nstandoff ensued.\\n\\n     The Federal Bureau of Investigation then made every\\nreasonable effort to bring this perilous situation to an end without\\nbloodshed and further loss of life.  The Bureau's efforts were\\nultimately unavailing because the individual with whom they were\\ndealing, David Koresh, was dangerous, irrational, and probably\\ninsane.\\n\\n     He engaged in numerous activities which violated both\\nfederal law and common standards of decency.  He was, moreover,\\nresponsible for the deaths and injuries which occurred during the\\naction against the compound in February.  Given his inclination\\ntowards violence and in an effort to protect his young hostages, no\\nprovocative actions were taken for more than seven weeks by federal\\nagents against the compound.\\n\\n     This weekend I was briefed by Attorney General Reno on\\nan operation prepared by the FBI, designed to increase pressure on\\nKoresh and persuade those in the compound to surrender peacefully.\\nThe plan included a decision to withhold the use of ammunition, even\\nin the face of fire, and instead to use tear gas that would not cause\\npermanent harm to health, but would, it was hoped, force the people\\nin the compound to come outside and to surrender.\\n\\n     I was informed of the plan to end the siege.  I\\ndiscussed it with Attorney General Reno.  I asked the questions I\\nthought it was appropriate for me to ask.  I then told her to do what\\nshe thought was right, and I take full responsibility for the\\nimplementation of the decision.\\n\\n     Yesterday's action ended in a horrible human tragedy.\\nMr. Koresh's response to the demands for his surrender by federal\\nagents was to destroy himself and murder the children who were his\\ncaptives, as well as all the other people who were there who did not\\nsurvive.  He killed those he controlled, and he bears ultimate\\nresponsibility for the carnage that ensued.\\n\\n     Now we must review the past with an eye towards the\\nfuture.  I have directed the United Stated Departments of Justice and\\nTreasury to undertake a vigorous and thorough investigation to\\nuncover what happened and why, and whether anything could have been\\ndne differently.  I have told the departments to involve independent\\nprofessional law enforcement officials in the investigation.  I\\nexpect to receive analysis and answers in whatever time is required\\nto complete the review.  Finally, I have directed the departments to\\ncooperate fully with all congressional inquiries so that we can\\ncontinue to be fully accountable to the American people.\\n\\n     I want to express my appreciation to the Attorney\\nGeneral, to the Justice Department, and to the federal agents on the\\nfront lines who did the best job they could under deeply difficult\\ncircumstances.\\n\\n     Again, I want to say as I did yesterday, I am very sorry\\nfor the loss of life which occurred at the beginning and at the end\\nof this tragedy in Waco.  I hope very much that others who will be\\ntempted to join cults and to become involved with people like David\\nKoresh will be deterred by the horrible scenes they have seen over\\nthe last seven weeks.  And I hope very much that the difficult\\nsituations which federal agents confronted there and which they will\\nbe doubtless required to confront in other contexts in the future\\nwill be somewhat better handled and better understood because of what\\nhas been learned now.\\n\\n     Q  Mr. President, can you, first of all, tell us why,\\nafter 51 days, you decided --\\n\\n     Q  Mr. President, can you describe for us what it is\\nthat Janet Reno outlined to you in your 15-minute phone conversation\\nwith --\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  I can't hear you both.  If one will go\\nfirst and then the other.\\n\\n     Q  Sorry.  Can you describe what Janet Reno --\\n\\n     Q  Mr. President --\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  I'll answer both your questions, but I\\ncan't do it at once.\\n\\n     Q  Can you describe what she told you on Sunday about\\nthe nature of the operation and how much detail you knew about it?\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  Yes.  I was told by the Attorney General\\nthat the FBI strongly felt that the time had come to take another\\nstep in trying to dislodge the people in the compound.  And she\\ndescribed generally what the operation would be -- that they wanted\\nto go in and use tear gas which had been tested not to cause\\npermanent damage to adults or to children, but which would make it\\nvery difficult for people to stay inside the building.  And it was\\nhoped that the tear gas would permit them to come outside.\\n\\n     I was further told that under no circumstances would our\\npeople fire any shots at them even if fired upon.  They were going to\\nshoot the tear gas from armored vehicles which would protect them and\\nthere would be no exchange of fire.  In fact, as you know, an awful\\nlot of shots were fired by the cult members at the federal officials.\\nThere were no shots coming back from the government side.\\n\\n     I asked a number of questions.  The first question I\\nasked is, why now?  We have waited seven weeks; why now?  The reasons\\nI was given were the following:\\n\\n     Number one, that there was a limit to how long the\\nfederal authorities could maintain with their limited resources the\\nquality and intensity of coverage by experts there.  They might be\\nneeded in other parts of the country.\\n\\n     Number two, that the people who had reviewed this had\\nnever seen a case quite like this one before, and they were convinced\\nthat no progress had been made recently and no progress was going to\\nbe made through the normal means of getting Koresh and the other cult\\nmembers to come out.\\n\\n     Number three, that the danger of their doing something\\nto themselves or to others was likely to increase, not decrease, with\\nthe passage of time.\\n\\n     And number four, that they had reason to believe that\\nthe children who were still inside the compound were being abused\\nsignificantly, as well as being forced to live in unsanitary and\\nunsafe conditions.\\n\\n     So for those reasons, they wanted to move at that time.\\nThe second question I asked the Attorney General is whether they had\\ngiven consideration to all of the things that could go wrong and\\nevaluated them against what might happen that was good.  She said\\nthat the FBI personnel on the scene and those working with them were\\nconvinced that the chances of bad things happening would only\\nincrease with the passage of time.\\n\\n     The third question I asked was, has the military been\\nconsulted?  As soon as the initial tragedy came to light in Waco,\\nthat's the first thing I asked to be done, because it was obvious\\nthat this was not a typical law enforcement situation.  Military\\npeople were then brought in, helped to analyze the situation and some\\nof the problems that were presented by it.   And so I asked if the\\nmilitary had been consulted.  The Attorney General said that they\\nhad, and that they were in basic agreement that there was only one\\nminor tactical difference of opinion between the FBI and the military\\n-- something that both sides thought was not of overwhelming\\nsignificance.\\n\\n     Having asked those questions and gotten those answers, I\\nsaid that if she thought it was the right thing to do, that she\\nshould proceed and that I would support it.  And I stand by that\\ntoday.\\n\\n     Q  Mr. President --\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  Wait.  Go ahead.\\n\\n     Q  Can you address the widespread perception --\\nreported widely, television, radio and newspapers -- that you were\\ntrying somehow to distance yourself from this disaster?\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  No, I'm bewildered by it.  The only\\nreason I made no public statement yesterday -- let me say -- the only\\nreason I made no public statement yesterday is that I had nothing to\\nadd to what was being said and I literally did not know until rather\\nlate in the day whether anybody was still alive other than those who\\nhad been actually seen and taken to the hospital or taken into\\ncustody.  It was purely and simply a question of waiting for events\\nto unfold.\\n\\n     There was -- I have -- I can't account for why people\\nspeculated one way or the other, but I talked to the Attorney General\\non the day before the action took place.  I talked to her yesterday.\\nI called her again late last night after she appeared on the Larry\\nKing Show, and I talked to her again this morning.  A President -- it\\nis not possible for a President to distance himself from things that\\nhappen when the federal government is in control.\\n\\n     I will say this, however.  I was, frankly, surprised\\nwould be a mild word, to say that anyone that would suggest that the\\nAttorney General should resign because some religious fanatics\\nmurdered themselves.  (Applause.)\\n\\n     I regret what happened, but it is not possible in this\\nlife to control the behavior of others in every circumstance.  These\\npeople killed four federal officials in the line of duty.  They were\\nheavily armed.  They fired on federal officials yesterday repeatedly,\\nand they were never fired back on.  We did everything we could to\\navoid the loss of life.  They made the decision to immolate\\nthemselves.  And I regret it terribly, and I feel awful about the\\nchildren.\\n\\n     But in the end, the last comment I had from Janet Reno,\\nis when -- and I talked to her on Sunday -- I said, now, I want you\\nto tell me once more why you believe -- not why they believe -- why\\nyou believe we should move now rather than wait some more.  And she\\nsaid, it's because of the children.  They have evidence that those\\nchildren are still being abused and that they're in increasingly\\nunsafe conditions, and that they don't think it will get any easier\\nwith time -- with the passage of time.  I have to take their word for\\nthat.  So that is where I think things stand.\\n\\n     Q  Can we assume then that you don't think this was\\nmishandled in view of the outcome, that you didn't run out of\\npatience?  And if you had it to do over again, would you really\\ndecide that way?\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  No -- well, I think what you can assume\\nis just exactly what I announced today.  This is a -- the FBI has\\ndone a lot of things right for this country over a long period of\\ntime.  This is the same FBI that found the people that bombed the\\nWorld Trade Center in lickety-split, record time.  We want an inquiry\\nto analyze the steps along the way.  Is there something else we\\nshould have known?  Is there some other question they should have\\nasked?  Is there some other question I should have asked?  Can I say\\nfor sure that no one -- that we could have done nothing else to make\\nthe outcome come different?  I don't know that.  That's why I want\\nthe inquiry and that's why I would like to make sure that we have\\nsome independent law enforcement people, not political people, but\\ntotally non-political, outside experts who can bring to bear the best\\nevidence we have.\\n\\n     There is, unfortunately, a rise in this sort of\\nfanaticism all across the world.  And we may have to confront it\\nagain.  And I want to know whether there is anything we can do,\\nparticularly when there are children involved.  But I do think it is\\nimportant to recognize that the wrong-doers in this case were the\\npeople who killed others and then killed themselves.\\n\\n     Q  Mr. President, were there any other options\\npresented to you for resolving this situation at any point from\\nFebruary 28th until yesterday?\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, yes, I got regular reports all\\nalong the way.  There were lots of other options pursued.  If you go\\nback -- you all covered it very well.  The FBI -- you did a very good\\njob of it.  I mean, the FBI and the other authorities there pursued\\nany number of other options all along the way, and a lot of them\\nearly on seemed to be working.  Some of the children got out, some of\\nthe other people left.  There was a -- at one point, there seemed to\\nbe some lines of communication opening up between Koresh and the\\nauthorities.  And then he would say things and not do them and things\\njust began to spin downward.\\n\\n     Whether there were other -- in terms of what happened\\nyesterday, the conversation I had with the Attorney General did not\\ninvolve other options except whether we should take more time with\\nthe present strategy we were pursuing -- because they said they\\nwanted to do this, because they thought this was the best way to get\\npeople out of the compound quickly before they could kill themselves.\\nThat's what they thought.\\n\\n     Q  Did the government know that the children did not\\nhave gas masks?\\n\\n     Q     congressional hearings once the situation -- are\\nyou in agreement with that?\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  That's up to the Congress.  They can do\\nwhatever they want.  But I think it's very important that the\\nTreasury and Justice Departments launch this investigation and bring\\nin some outside experts.  And as I said in my statement, if any\\ncongressional committees want to look into it, we will fully\\ncooperate.  There is nothing to hide here.

He was unable\\n##to find a wealth of scientific statements in the Holy Qur'an, but,\\n##what he did find made sense with modern understanding.

Was\\nDS&gt;that the one with the little illuminated Dragon\\'s Head on the front\\nDS&gt;fender, a style later copied by Indian, and the round side covers?\\n\\nNo. Not at all. The Viking was a trick little unit made way back when\\n(forties? fifties?) when Spag was trying to make a go of it in racing.\\nThe first iteration (the Springer) was a boxer twin, very similar to Max\\nFriz\\'s famous design, but with an overhead \"point cam\" (see below for\\nmore on the valvetrain). The problem was that the thing had no ground\\nclearance whatsoever. The solution was to curve the cylinder bores, so\\nthat the ground clearance was substantially increased:\\n\\n\\n      ==@==   &lt;-Springer motor (front)\\n                 Viking motor (front) -&gt;   \\\\=@=/\\n\\nThis is roughly the idea, except that the bores were gradually curved\\naround a radius, as the pistons were loath to make a sharp-angled turn\\nin the middle of their stroke. The engine also had curved connecting\\nrods to accomodate the stroke.\\n\\nThe engine stuck out so far because of its revolutionary (and still\\nunique) overhead cam system. Through the use of clever valve timing and\\nand extrordinarily trick valve linkage, only a single cam lobe was\\nrequired to drive both overhead valves.\\n\\nJust as revolutionary was the hydraulic valve actuation, which used a\\npressurized stream of oil to power the \"waterwheel\" which kept the lobe\\nspinning over. One side effect that required some rather brutal\\nengineering fixes was that until the engine\\'s oil pressure came up to\\nnormal, the engine\\'s valve timing would be more or less random,\\nresulting in some impressive start-up valve damage. The solution was a\\nlittle hand crank that pressurized the cases before you started the\\nbeast, remarkably similar to the system used in new Porsches to\\npressurize the oil system before the car is started (the cage, however,\\nuses an electric oil pump. Wimps).\\n\\nDespite this fix, the engine had a nasty propensity for explosively\\nfiring its valves into the pistons when a cylinder would temporarily\\nlose a bit of oil pressure in a corner. The solution was to run even\\nhigher oil pressures and change the gaskets and seals regularly. This\\nwas feasible because it was a racing engine.\\n\\nWith just a single overhead lobe, and no pushrod/shaft/chain towers\\nbecause of the hydraulic system, the head of the engine came to an\\nalmost perfect point:\\n\\n                    /\\\\\\n                   /()\\\\   &lt;-lobe\\n                  / XX \\\\  &lt;-complex linkage (not shown due to\\n valvestems -&gt;   / \\\\  / \\\\    complexity)\\n                |  |   | |\\n                |  |===| |\\n                    =0=  &lt;---piston\\n                     |\\n                             Note that the tip was not truly vertical\\n                             (it was at about a 70 degree angle to the\\n                             ground, and this drawing doesn\\'t show the\\n                             curvature because there was none in the\\n                             head itself.

EDT\\n\\n\\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Good afternoon.  Ladies and gentlemen, \\ntwo months ago I presented a comprehensive plan to reduce our \\nnational deficit and to increase our investment in the American \\npeople, their jobs and their economic future.  The federal budget \\nplan passed Congress in record time, and created a new sense of hope \\nand opportunity in the country.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Then, the short-term jobs plan I presented to Congress, \\nwhich would create a half a million jobs in the next two years passed \\nthe House of Representatives two weeks ago.  It now has the support \\nof a majority of the United States Senate. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     All of these members of Congress know it's time to get \\nthe economy moving again, to get job growth going again, to get a \\nfast start on the investments we need to build a lasting prosperity.  \\nUnfortunately, a minority of the members of the United States Senate \\nhave used gridlock tactics to prevent their colleagues from working \\nthe will of the majority on the jobs bill.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     When Congress returns, I ask every senator from every \\nstate and from both parties to remember what is at stake.  The issue \\nis not politics, it's people.  Sixteen million of them are looking \\nfor full-time jobs and can't find them.  These men and women don't \\ncare about who's up or down in Washington.  They care about paying \\nthe rent and meeting the mortgage payment, about putting food on the \\ntable and buying shoes for their children, about regaining a sense of \\ndignity that comes from doing a day's work and supporting their \\nfamilies and drawing a paycheck.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     They're asking those of us who have the privilege of \\nserving to put aside politics and do something now to move our \\neconomy forward.  I am prepared to do that.  And I have been working \\nwith the Senate to come up with an adjusted package that meets some \\nof the concerns of those who have been blocking action on the jobs \\nplan.  I'm willing to compromise, so long as we keep the focus on \\njobs, keep the focus on growth and keep the focus on meeting unmet \\nnational needs.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Our opponents have been asking for a smaller package.  \\nToday I ask them to join me in determining exactly what kind and what \\nsize package Congress can approve that actually meets the needs of \\nthe American people. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     But even as we make those reductions and the package \\nwill be smaller, I believe we must address problems that are on the \\nminds of millions of Americans, and one in particular, and that is \\nthe need to toughen law enforcement in our society to deal with the \\ndramatic rise in violent crime. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     So I will ask, even in this reduced package, for an \\nadditional $200 million in federal funding to help local communities \\nto rehire police officers who have been laid off because of the \\nfiscal problems caused by the national recession.  Together, with a \\nmatching effort by local governments, this could put as many as \\n10,000 police officers back on the job, and back on the beat in \\ncommunities all across our nation.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     At a time when too many of our people live in fear of \\nviolent crime, when too many businesses have closed and too many \\npeople have lost their jobs because people are afraid to leave their \\nhomes, rehiring thousands of officers is one of the best investments \\nAmerica can make.  And I ask both Houses of Congress to make that \\ninvestment in our people's safety and in their piece of mind.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I believe in the need for strong federal action to keep \\nthe economy going toward recovery and to create jobs.  Make no \\nmistake about it:  I will fight for these priorities as hard as I \\never have.  I will never forget that the people sent me here to fight \\nfor their jobs, their future and for fundamental change.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I want to thank the police officers who are here today \\nand tell you that not a single one of them knew before they came here \\nthat I had determined to ask for more money in this jobs bill to \\nrehire police officers.  They came here because they believe in the \\nsummer jobs portion of the package.  And I want them to be free to \\ntalk about that.  They came here not out of any law enforcement \\nconcern other than the fact that they wanted the kids in this country \\nto have a chance to have jobs this summer, to have safer streets and \\na brighter and more peaceful future.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I say what I say today not just because it's good for \\nlaw enforcement but because it's good for the people who live in \\nthese communities.  I have always supported community policing not \\nonly because it helps to prevent crime and to lower the crime rate, \\nbut because it cements better relationships between people in law \\nenforcement and the people that they're hired to protect.  It reduces \\nthe chances of abusive action by police officers and increases the \\nchances of harmony and safe streets at the same time.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     These are the kinds of things that we are trying to do.  \\nI promised in my campaign that I'd do everything I could to put \\nanother 100,000 police officers on the street over the next four \\nyears.  This makes a good downpayment on that.  This keeps in mind \\nthe core of the jobs package.  And this will help us to move forward.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     So I ask the people in the Senate who have blocked the \\njobs bill, let's work together.  I can accept a reduced package if \\nyou will increase your commitment to safe streets.  I do not accept \\nthe fact that we should reduce our commitment to summer jobs or to \\nbuilding our infrastructure or to doing those other things that will \\ncreate real and lasting  prosperity for our people.  I have done my \\npart now to end the gridlock; I ask you to do yours.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I want now to give the people who are here with me on \\nthe platform a chance to make some remarks and to be heard by the \\nAmerican people -- beginning with Janet Reno, the distinguished \\nAttorney General.\\n  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   * \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President, can you tell us -- do you think that \\nthe jobs package could be put in further jeopardy by controversy over \\nthe suggestion of a VAT tax at this point in the congressional \\ndialogue?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Not at all.  I think it should have --\\nthey wouldn't have any relationship one to the other.  First of all, \\nI made absolutely no decision on that.  You should know that there's \\na lot of support in the business community and the labor community -- \\npeople have asked us to consider that because of the enormous burden \\nof the present system on many of our major employers, particularly \\nmany of those that we depend upon to generate jobs and to carry the \\nstrength of this economy.  But I have made absolutely no decision \\nthat would even approach that on that or any other kind of general \\ntax.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Do you personally believe that the American public \\nis ready to pay for -- to have another tax to pay for health care?  I \\nmean, apart from what business and labor leaders have said --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I'm not going to speculate on that.  I \\nwill say this:  The real issue is how quickly we can recycle the \\nbenefits of all the savings to cover the cost.  I mean, that is --\\neveryone knows that if you do what we're proposing to do, if you \\nstreamline the insurance system, if you fix the system so that \\nthere's no longer an enormous economic incentive to over-utilize or \\nover-provide certain services, if you provide primary and preventive \\ncare in places where it isn't now, every single analysis shows \\nabsolutely massive savings to the health care system.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     The real question is whether you can transfer those \\nsavings to cover those who have no coverage now or those who have \\nvirtually no coverage so that you provide people the security.  I \\nhave no idea.  The polls say that, but I don't know.  All I know is \\nthe polls that I see in the press that many of you have commissioned, \\nthey say overwhelmingly the American people want the security of an \\naffordable health care system.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     But I don't think that has anything to do with this \\nstimulus, and it certainly shouldn't have.  People want a job first \\nand foremost.  They want that more than anything else.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Now that you've announced your willingness to \\ncompromise on the stimulus package, can you tell us what parts of \\nyour package you consider vital and uncompromisable?  I assume summer \\njobs is one.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I want the summer jobs; I want the \\nhighway program and I want the police program.  I still intend -- let \\nme say this:  I still intend to fully and aggressively push the crime \\nbill, which did not pass the Congress last year.  This is a \\nsupplement to that, not a substitute for it in any way.  But I think \\nwe need to do that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I think we need the Ryan White funds because of the \\nenormous health care burdens to the communities that are inordinately \\nand disproportionately affected by the problems of caring for people \\nwith AIDS.  And there are several other things that I think should be \\ndone.  We have to do the Agriculture Department meat inspectors; the \\nsafety of the public depends on that.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     There are a number of other things that I don't -- I \\ndon't think any of it should be cut, but I have given Senator \\nMitchell and Senator Byrd -- I talked to them.  And Senator Dole \\ncalled me yesterday to discuss this, and I told him that I would call \\nhim back.  I called him back last night in New Hampshire and we \\ndiscussed this.  And I basically asked them to talk today, and said \\nthat I would not make any statements about any specifics until at \\nleast they had a chance to talk to see whether or not they could \\nreach some accord.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     So I don't want to be any more specific than I have been \\nalready, and let's see if they can talk it out.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  When you talked to Senator Dole and Senator \\nMitchell did you tell them about your -- increase also, that $200 \\nmillion, that you want that as part of the package?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I did -- I told Senator -- I left word \\nfor Senator Mitchell last night about it.  When I talked to Senator \\nDole -- I don't remember for sure -- I do not believe I mentioned it.  \\nBut I did tell him that I was prepared to reduce the package and I \\nwanted to break the gridlock, and I told him that I was working on a \\nreformulation of it so that -- in the hope that it would become even \\nmore focused on jobs and the kinds of issues that I thought the \\nAmerican people wanted us to address.  And this is certainly \\nconsistent with that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Thank you.\",\n  \"\\nOh?

So I\\nintend to put together what I call the \"American Horror File\": a\\ncompilation of cases where the American government has run roughshod\\nover the rights of its citizens over the last few years, focusing\\nespecially on deaths and injuries resulting from no-knock warrants,\\nand financial ruin to innocents resulting from civil forfeiture laws,\\nbut including any other cases for which I can find decent\\ndocumentation.  I hope to make people blood-boiling, artery-bursting,\\nred-hot enraged at their government.\\n\\nThe end result will probably be a book in electronic form (ASCII text\\nand postscript files) detailing the government\\'s crimes of recent\\nyears.  This book will be distributed at cost, and I will encourage\\npeople to post copies to BBS\\'s, send copies on disk to friends, and\\nprint out copies and give them to neighbors.\\n\\nThis is a call for your help.

The 60 is the `aspect ratio'; it indicates the height of the\\n    sidewall of the tire relative to the overall width.  Our example tire\\n    has a sidewall height of 0.60 * 195 ~= 117 mm.  The 14 is the wheel\\n    diameter in inches; there are also some special tires called `TRX'\\n    tires which have three digit metric wheel diameter designations, like\\n    390, which is in millimeters.  The R means Radial, and the H is a speed\\n    rating indicating the highest speed at which the tire, when properly\\n    inflated and carrying an appropriate load, may safely operate.  Common\\n    speed ratings are S (112MPH), T (118MPH), H (130MPH), and V (up to\\n    150MPH.)\\n\\n    Recent changes to the method for specifying tire sizes move the speed\\n    rating to a different part of the designation; you may therefore find\\n    designations like 195/60R14 85H; the 85 indicates the per-tire load\\n    associated with the speed rating -- exceeding this load in continuous\\n    operation at the rated speed is dangerous practice.  What follows is\\n    a table showing a number of `load indices' and corresponding maximum\\n    per-tire loads:\\n\\n    Load Index       50   51   88   89   112   113   145   149   157\\n    Max Load (Kg)   190  195  560  580  1120  1150  2900  3250  4125\\n\\n    Note that the usual mass vs. weight confusion occurs in this table.\\n\\n    In some cases, the letters P or LT may be found in front of a tire\\n    size; the LT designation indicates Light Truck, and the P designation\\n    indicates Passenger car.  If no letter is given, then the application\\n    of the tire is Passenger car usage.  As far as I know, these letters\\n    only appear in the US market.  The LT designation is prinicipally of\\n    interest to owners of light trucks and other utility vehicles.  For\\n    the owner of a passenger vehicle, there is no meaningful difference\\n    between a tire with a P designation and one with no designation at\\n    all.\\n\\n    If the aspect ratio is omitted, it is probably 80, but may be 78.\\n\\n    Tires with an MS (mud/snow) designation may have their speed rating\\n    reduced by 20 km/h (about 12mph.)\\n\\n    There is an additional set of ratings on tires for temperature,\\n    traction, and treadwear.  Temperature and Traction are graded\\n    A, B, and C (with A the best and C the worst); treadwear is\\n    a numeric rating.  These values are of limited value, as they\\n    are assigned somewhat arbitrarily by tire manufacturers and are\\n    thus not useful in comparing different brands of tires.\\n\\nQ:  My car has tires with a funny size designation:  185/65HR390; can i put\\n    normal tires on the car?\\n\\nA:  Your tires are called TRX tires; they were devised by Michelin.\\n    Because of a somewhat different bead design, they are incompatible\\n    with normal tires; Michelin used a different diameter wheel for them\\n    so that they could not be mounted on the wrong type wheel (and so that\\n    more conventional tires could not be mounted on TRX type wheels.)\\n    You will need to aquire different wheels to put a normal tire on your\\n    car; it is barely possible to fit normal tires on TRX wheels, and horribly\\n    dangerous to do so (the tires may simply peel off the rims in a corner,\\n    or possibly blow out at high speed.)  TRX type tires are becoming hard\\n    to find; in addition to Michelin, Avon makes suitable tires.  Goodyear\\n    has apparently discontinued their line of TRX tires.\\n\\nQ:  Can I rotate radials from side to side, or rotate them only on one side\\n    of my car?\\n\\nA:  Car and tire manufacturers have differing views on this subject; many\\n    say that swapping radials between the left and right hand sides of a\\n    car is now ok (this group includes Michelin and Goodyear); others\\n    (for example, Pirelli and Nokia) will void warranties if such swapping\\n    is done.  The best advice is to read your tire manual carefully before\\n    rotating your tires, and stick to the manufacturer's recommendations.\\n\\nQ:  How many snow tires should I buy, and if I buy 2, which end of the\\n    car should I put them on?\\n\\nA:  In short, 4, and both ends.  To explain, many drivers in areas that don't\\n    get excessive snow or who don't drive agressively (or at all) in snow\\n    conditions get away with only two snows on the drive wheels, but there\\n    are circumstances where this can be dangerous practice.  With a rear\\n    wheel drive car, you can choose between being able to start the car\\n    going (a function of the rear axle) or stopping and turning the car\\n    (a function of the front axle.)  In a front wheel drive car, you start,\\n    stop, and turn with the front end.  The primary risk of putting the\\n    snow tires on the front only is that if you have to put on the brakes\\n    while going downhill, you run a serious risk of going downhill backwards.\\n\\nRadar Detectors and Speed Limits:\\n\\nQ:  Why aren't there any comments on Radar Detectors and Speed Limits\\n    in this Q&A posting?\\n\\nA:  Because questions about detectors and speed limits crossposted between\\n    misc.consumers and rec.autos.* always start long, tedious, and pointless\\n    flame wars.  If you want to talk about either of these topics, please\\n    subscribe to rec.autos or alt.flame and keep it there.\\n\\nSafety Equipment:\\n\\nQ:  Do airbags really work?\\n\\nA:  Preliminary statistics suggest the following:  Airbags work much\\n    better than no belts; good 3 point belts alone work much better than\\n    Airbags alone, and AirBags + 3 point belts work slightly better than\\n    3 point belts alone.  The con to airbags is that some designs tend\\n    to burn the driver's hands when venting the byproducts of the\\n    explosion that occurs inside the bag, and that some designs (but\\n    not all) may knock the driver's hands from the wheel, making retention\\n    of control of the vehicle after the bag deflates more difficult.\\n\\nBrake Questions:\\n\\nQ:  Do I always need to get the rotors on my disk brakes turned?  Midas\\n    always wants to do this.\\n\\nA:  No.  There are specific conditions that mandate turning or replacing\\n    rotors; some shops try and make a little extra money by replacing rotors\\n    more often than is strictly necessary.  if the rotors are not warped\\n    warped, and only lightly grooved, then there is no need to replace or\\n    to turn them.  Note also that some rotors (the rotors on many Hondas\\n    are a good example) are so narrow to begin with that it is not practical\\n    to turn them; they must be replaced when they become too thin, warped,\\n    or badly grooved.\\n\\nQ:  They tell me I should downshift when braking to slow my car down.  Is\\n    this really a good idea?\\n\\nA:  It used to be a very good idea, back in the days of mediocre, fade\\n    prone drum brakes.  In modern disc brake equipped cars, use of\\n    downshifting to slow the car is not really necessary, except in cases\\n    of long, steep downhill runs.  Otherwise, modern disc brakes are more\\n    than adequate to stop a passenger car in all circumstances, and they\\n    are much cheaper to repair than clutch linings.\\n\\n    On the other hand, many standard driver's license tests in the USA\\n    still specify that the driver being tested downshift under braking; I\\n    suggest that before taking a US driver's test, you either 1) learn to\\n    do this smoothly (which takes some time and practice) or 2) borrow a\\n    car with an automatic to take the test.\\n\\nQ:  How often should I replace my brake fluid?\\n\\nA:  Probably more often than you do.  Traditional brake fluids tend to\\n    absorb water; this water can corrode internal parts of the brake\\n    system and also lower the boiling point of the fluid.  DOT-3 type\\n    are older fluids; DOT-4 and DOT-5 are newer specifications.  The\\n    principal differences are in wet and dry boiling points; the dry\\n    boiling point is important in fresh brake fluid, but the wet boiling\\n    point is important in older brake fluid.  DOT-3 fluids have the lowest\\n    wet and dry boiling point _requirements_; DOT-4 fluids have better\\n    boiling point requirements; and DOT-5 fluids have the best boiling\\n    point requirements (but DOT-5 fluids are not clearly superior; see\\n    the next Q&A for more details.)  While the requirements imply that\\n    DOT-4 fluids are better than DOT-3 fluids, there may be specific\\n    cases where a DOT-3 fluid is preferable, but these are mostly\\n    competition applications.  Otherwise, DOT-4 type fluids offer _much_\\n    improved brake pedal feel.  Replacement once a year is recommended for\\n    DOT-4 fluids, although agressive drivers may profit by changing out\\n    fluid more frequently, or at least bleeding a modest amount of fluid\\n    out of the brake calipers fairly regularly.\\n\\nQ:  What about DOT-5 brake fluids?\\n\\nA:  This breaks down in to two parts.  The DOT-5 specification looks\\n    excellent for performance, but the first DOT-5 fluids were Silicone\\n    based.  Silicone fluids are a tricky proposition.  Unlike DOT-3 and\\n    DOT-4 fluids, they do not absorb water at all.  While this may sound\\n    like a feature, the problem is that any water present pools up in\\n    such systems, interfering with braking performance and corroding any\\n    metals at the spot where the pooling is occuring.  The water will tend\\n    to migrate downwards in the braking system to the brake calipers, where\\n    most of the corrosion occurs.\\n\\n    Because of this phenomenon, it is essential when converting to\\n    Silicone to empty the entire brake system and flush it throughly\\n    beforehand; some even recommend replacing all rubber parts in the\\n    brake system when converting to Silicone fluids.\\n\\n    Two other issues that come up with silicone fluids:  1) they are\\n    difficult to pour cleanly (that is, without air bubbles), which\\n    interferes with getting a good brake pedal feel, and 2) while they\\n    generally have much higher boiling points than DOT-4 fluids, they\\n    do have high temperature failure modes which are indistinguishable\\n    in effect from boiling DOT-4 fluids.  SIlicone fluids may make sense\\n    in some street car applications, but they are certainly not\\n    recommended for high performance driving applications, and the\\n    economics are questionable for street use.\\n\\n    I have recently become aware of new fluids that meet the DOT-5 standard\\n    that do not contain Silicones; these fluids appear to be reasonably\\n    compatible with the older DOT-3 and DOT-4 fluids, but I have little\\n    information at this time.\\n\\nQ:  ABS is available on some of the cars I'm looking at, but it costs\\n    more.  Is it worth it?\\n\\nA:  This does not have a cut and dried answer; therefore, this answer will\\n    be quite long in order to cover the pros and cons.  The short answer\\n    is that ABS costs more, both initially, and to maintain, will generally\\n    work better for the `average driver' (that is to say, a driver who does\\n    not have extensive experience in high performance driving techniques),\\n    and may require the `unlearning' of some obsolete braking techniques\\n    like pump braking which should be unlearned in any case.\\n\\n    Now for the long answer.  ABS works by monitering the wheels of the\\n    car, looking for signs of locked brakes.  It may or may not be able\\n    be able to distinguish between the different wheels (there are several\\n    systems on the market.)  It cannot detect impending lockup (which is\\n    what you would really want in an ideal world), but only the existence\\n    of lockup.  The sensors used vary; some of the less well designed\\n    sensors are sensitive to tire size, and to brake pad material, and\\n    may cease to function properly if the owner deviates from original\\n    equipment or OE-equivalent components.\\n\\n    When the sensors detect lockup, the ABS system responds by unlocking\\n    the brakes (either individually, or all at once, depending on the\\n    system.)  If the driver keeps their foot firmly planted, the ABS\\n    will end up cycling between the locked and unlocked states (if a\\n    sensor existed that could detect _impending lockup_, then we could\\n    sit right at that point, which is where maximum braking effect is\\n    achieved.)  This pulsing can often be felt in the brake pedal, as\\n    the system cycles.  The percentage of the time that the brakes are\\n    truly engaged is called the `duty cycle'; typically in an ABS system\\n    this is about 40%  On dry pavement, a trained driver can beat this\\n    duty cycle quite reliably using a technique called threshold braking;\\n    on wet pavement, braking is so chancy that ABS will outperform\\n    threshold braking nearly every time.  Unfortunately, on mud and on\\n    snow, often maximum braking effect can be acheived with the brakes\\n    locked; only Audi, of the manufacturers producing ABS-equipped cars,\\n    has seen fit to provide a disable switch for the ABS system for this\\n    eventuality.\\n\\n    A particularly important feature of ABS is that it preserves\\n    steering control.  This is the case simply because, if you are\\n    braking near the limit and turn the wheel, the ABS will release\\n    the brakes if it sees steering-triggered lockup, and back off\\n    on the percentage of the time that the brakes are applied.\\n    Braking distances will lengthen accordingly.\\n\\n    An important caution:  ABS cannot exceed the maximum theoretical\\n    braking force in any given situation; if you start sliding on\\n    glare ice, don't expect an ABS system to help you out very much.\\n    The coefficient of friction is not changed by the presence of an\\n    ABS system in your car.\\n\\n    As far as maintenence goes, in addition to the potential\\n    restrictions I've listed above, you have to worry about the\\n    following:  1) parts costs are much higher; the OE master cylinder\\n    for my obscure european sedan lists for $185, but the OE master\\n    cylinder for the ABS-equipped version of the same car lists for\\n    over $1000.  Most manufacturers explicitly forbid use of DOT-5\\n    (silicone) brake fluids in ABS-equipped vehicles.  Because of\\n    the potential cost of replacement of corroded brake system\\n    components, regular (I suggest annual) replacement of brake fluid\\n    becomes very important.\\n\\nQ:  What about this threshold braking business?\\n\\nA:  [normally, I'd not put this in the consumers Q&A, but recent\\n    publicity about a number of accidents involving police drivers\\n    in ABS-equipped Chevy Caprices suggests that this section is\\n    needed here -- rpw]\\n\\n    Threshold braking is a technique practiced by all serious high\\n    performance drivers; if made a habit, it replaces the `stab\\n    the pedal and lock 'em up' panic habit entirely, and is much\\n    to be prefered.  Basically, the premise is that tires generate\\n    maximum braking force when they have just started to slide, but\\n    just before the wheels lock up entirely.  Drivers who threshold\\n    brake learn to feel what this `threshold' feels like, and learn\\n    to search for it and hit it on the application of the brake\\n    pedal.  In many cars, you can feel that you are near the\\n    threshold when the pedal starts to firm up as you depress it.\\n    In any case, if you can't hear the tires whine just a bit, you're\\n    not very near the threshold.\\n\\n    In a car with ABS, often there is a twinge in the pedal just\\n    before the system starts cycling; if the driver backs off on\\n    the pedal just a tad when the twinge is felt, then they are very\\n    close to the threshold and they'll probably achieve better\\n    stopping distances than if they just punched it and let the ABS\\n    take over.\\n\\n    Recently, there has been a rash of publicity over a number of\\n    accidents, and one death, involving police cars equipped with\\n    ABS systems.  The police departments in question quickly blamed\\n    the new ABS systems, but according to Autoweek magazine, it now\\n    seems clear that the problem was a lack of training; none of the\\n    involved officers had any recent performance driving training.\\n    There is reason to believe that the drivers reacted to the pulsing\\n    brake pedal by `pump braking', an old and discredited technique\\n    of stabbing and releasing the brake pedal, the goal being to\\n    try and get brakes back with a failing hydraulic system.  If you\\n    think about it for a minute, you'll realize that pump braking must\\n    cut the effective operation of a working brake system by at least\\n    1/2, so if you cut the 40% duty cycle of an ABS system by that\\n    much, you are giving up most of your brakes for the wrong reason.\\n    Threshold braking has the advantage in that it is an effective\\n    and useful technique regardless of whether your car has ABS; if\\n    you do fear a failed hydraulic system, then one or two stabs at\\n    the pedal will be sufficient.    \\n\\nGas Questions:\\n\\nQ:  Does High Octane gasoline help?\\n\\nA:  Maybe, maybe not.  Some cars have knock sensors, and can adjust the\\n    engine timing or turbocharger boost to suit the gasoline being used.\\n    On most cars, however, you should use the cheapest gas that makes your\\n    car run well.  Check your owner's manual for details on what your car\\n    needs.\\n\\nQ:  My car was made for leaded gasoline.  Will unleaded gas hurt it?\\n\\nA:  It is possible that unleaded gas may *slightly* increase valve wear,\\n    although the Amoco Oil company argues otherwise.  The actual increase\\n    in valve wear will be almost unnoticeable, however, as modern leaded\\n    gasolines actually contain very little lead.  You should, however,\\n    check your owner's manual; many cars from the early 1970s do not\\n    actually require leaded gasoline.\\n\\nQ:  Do fuel treatments help?  What kind should I use?\\n\\nA:  Some do and some don't.  During the winter, it is a good idea to use\\n    dry gas; however, some may be harmful to fuel injection systems.\\n    Never use an additive containing Methanol (sometimes called Methyl\\n    Alcohol); such additives may damage fuel systems in cars with carbs\\n    and almost certainly will damage cars with fuel injection.\\n\\n    Manufacturer's opinions vary on additives containing Ethanol (sometimes\\n    called Ethyl Alcohol); if your car has fuel injection, check the owner's\\n    manual on your car before  using these.  Most manufacturers consider\\n    10% Ethanol acceptable in gasoline.  Additives with Isopropyl Alcohol\\n    (Isopropanol), and Petroleum  Distillates are fine in fuel injected\\n    cars.\\n\\n    An occasional bottle of fuel injector cleaner is helpful in cars with\\n    fuel injectors, although many premium gasolines contain detergents that\\n    do the same job.  Some off brands of fuel injector cleaners contain\\n    Ethanol or Methanol; always check the ingredients before putting anything\\n    in your gas tank.\\n\\n    There are a small number of particularly good additives; these are\\n    noticeably more expensive that the run-of-the-mill ones, but work\\n    much, much better.  Among these are Chevron Techron, Redline SL-1,\\n    Wurth `Lubrimoly Ventil Sauber', and BG 44K.  A bottle of one of these,\\n    once every six months, is highly recommended.\\n\\nQ:  What about detergent gasolines?\\n\\nA:  The quality of detergent packages in gasolines varies somewhat; BMW\\n    has instituted a testing program, and gasoline brands which pass this\\n    test may advertise that fact.  Stickers indicating passage of the test\\n    are now beginning to appear on fuel pumps at gas stations.  If such\\n    gasolines are used, then fuel injector cleaners are probably optional.\\n    Beforewarned that while use of BMW approved gasolines will keep a clean\\n    engine clean, they may not clean a motor with bad valve deposits.\\n\\nLubrication Questions:\\n\\nQ:  What do the numbers and letters in a motor oil designation mean?\\n\\nA:  There are several different items encoded.  There is a two-letter\\n    code indicating the type of detergent package that the manufacturer\\t\\n    uses in the oil; this looks like SE,SF,CD or such.  The S codes are\\n    for gasoline engine applications; the C codes are for diesel engine\\n    applications.  The second letter is assigned in sequence as new levels\\n    of protection are developed; thus SF is considered better than SE,\\n    SE is considered better than SD, and so forth.\\n\\n    The more noticeable designation is the oil weight.  This is either\\n    a single number (e.g., 30 weight) or a pair of numbers separated by\\n    the letter W (e.g., 10W30.)  The latter type is much more commonly\\n    used these days, and are the only type that most automobile\\n    manufacturers specify in operators manuals.  The first number in the\\n    designation (10W) is the apparent viscosity of the oil when it is cold;\\n    the W stands for `winter'.  The second number (30) is the viscosity\\n    of the oil when hot.  There is a trick here; the oil doesn't actually\\n    get thicker (turn from 10 weight to 30 weight) as it gets hotter.  What\\n    is actually happening is that when the oil is cold, it has the viscosity\\n    of a cold 10 weight oil.  as it gets hotter, it doesn't get thin as fast\\n    as a 10W oil would; by the time it is up to temperature, it has the\\n    viscosity of a hot 30 weight oil.\\n\\n    Note that these numbers actually specify ranges of viscosities; not\\n    all 10W oils have exactly the same viscosity when cold, and not all\\n    30 weight oils have the same viscosity when hot.  Note also that the\\n    novel behaviour of multi-grade oils is caused by additives, and it has\\n    been reported that with the sole exception of Castrol GTX, 10W40 oils\\n    do not retain their multi-grade characteristics well over time.  10W30,\\n    15W40, and 20W50 oils work very well, though.\\n\\nQ:  Are `quick lube' places any good?\\n\\nA:  Some do adequate work, but there are quite a few incompetent ones out\\n    there.  Let the buyer beware, watch them while they work, make sure\\n    that they don't overtorque the oil drain plug, and keep your hand on\\n    your wallet at all times.\\n\\nQ:  Are oil additives like Slick-50 or Tufoil any good?\\n\\nA:  Slick-50 and Tufoil are PTFE-based additives.  Many of these have\\n    come onto the market recently; they are different from the moly-based\\n    additives that have been around since the early 50's.  PTFE is the\\n    chemical name for Teflon(TM), a trademark owned by DuPont. In general,\\n    auto manufacturers do not recommend use of these products.  Most USENET\\n    responses to questions on these additives are favorable (slight\\n    increase of MPG after application, smoother revving) but long term\\n    results (whether PTFE additives are effective after 5K miles) are\\n    debatable.  Some manufacturers (such as Saab) claim that either the\\n    product or the engine flush that preceeds application causes\\n    deterioration of the oil seals and eventual leakage.  Some BMW owners\\n    have reported death of valve seals shortly after the addition of\\n    Slick 50 to their cars.  This writer has been cautioned by a Slick-50\\n    Dealer (!) that Slick-50 should _not_ be used in Japanese motors, as\\n    it may clog the oil return passages in the engine.  Otherwise, there are\\n    no known reports of damage caused by PTFE additives.\\n\\n    On the other hand, there are satified Slick 50 customers in the world.\\n\\nQ:  Do synthetic oils really work?\\n\\nA:  Yes, but.  More specifically, most auto manufactuers accept synthetics,\\n    but disagree with the extremely long oil change intervals claimed by\\n    oil manufacturers.  Auto manufacturers recommend that you continue to\\n    change oil at the intervals recommended in the owners manual for your\\n    car.  Even if you decide to try the longer intervals, at least change\\n    the oil filter at regular intervals, as synthetics get just as dirty\\n    as conventional oils.\\n\\n    Synthetic gear lubricants for manual transmissions are another matter\\n    entirely; Amsoil, Redline, and AGIP are very highly regarded and very\\n    effective.  Mobil 1 synthetic gear lube gets mixed reviews, however.\\n\\nQ:  Manufacturers are specifying longer and longer oil change intervals.\\n    How often should I change my oil?\\n\\nA:  It depends on how you drive.  If your car always (or nearly always)\\n    gets warmed up, and you don't drive it very hard and keep the revs\\n    down, the manufacturer's recommendation is probably fine.  If, however,\\n    you drive it hard, drive it at high revs, or alternatively, if you\\n    only drive it to and from the supermarket so that it doesn't get up\\n    to temperature, then you may wish to change oil much more often,\\n    perhaps at 3000 mile intervals (given that most manufacturers are\\n    now specifying 7500 mile intervals.)  If you don't drive your car\\n    much at all (say 7500 miles a year), then you probably want to change\\n    oil every six months anyway.  If you are storing a car during the winter,\\n    then change oil before storing it and change oil when you bring it out\\n    of storage.\\n\\nMisc. Questions:\\n\\nQ:  My car has a timing belt.  I hear that bad things happen when they\\n    break.  What's the story?\\n\\nA:  It depends on the internal design of the motor.  Early Ford Escorts,\\n    for example, will suffer severe valve damage if the belt breaks, but\\n    the newer cars will just require a tow and installation of a new belt.\\n    Some Honda motors will not be damaged, but others will be.\\n\\n    If no replacement interval is specified for your car, then change the\\n    belt at least every 60,000 miles; some cars may require more frequent\\n    replacement.  Ask your dealer or independent mechanic.  Also, ask if\\n    there are any related repairs that should take place at the same time\\n    (for example, the same Ford Escorts that suffer valve damage also have\\n    a timing belt driven water pump, which has been known to seize,\\n    destroying the timing belt, and which then causes major valve damage\\n    as a side effect.  Replacing the timing belt while ignoring the water\\n    pump can be a costly mistake.)\\n\\nQ:  Why would anyone be stupid enough to design a motor so that it\\n    self destructs when the timing belt breaks?\\n\\nA:  For performance reasons.  Compromising piston design so that the\\n    valves and pistons will not collide requires that the compression\\n    ratio of the engine be reduced significantly; this is why you are\\n    more likely to avoid valve damage in economy cars than in performance\\n    oriented vehicles.\\n\\nQ:  What causes Unintended Acceleration?\\n\\nA:  The final report of the National Highway, Transportation, and Safety\\n    Administration concluded that unintended acceleration could not be\\n    caused by any mechanical failure of the vehicle in question and at the\\n    same time be consistent with the physical evidence.  The NHTSA report\\n    goes on to conclude that `pedal misapplication' by the vehicle operator\\n    is probably the cause.\",\n  '\\nFor me, it would be an obvious choice: Armed self-defence is clearly\\nand strongly protected by the Colorado Constitution and the laws\\nof the state. In the very clear-cut situation of your hypothetical,\\nI wouldn\\'t have anything to fear from the police (unless I had been\\npublicly carrying the weapon concealed, something I\\'m not in\\nthe habit of doing... Even then, the worst I\\'d have to deal with \\nwas a class 2 misdemeanor.) Even if the situation were not so\\nclear, and I might have to worry about arrest for manslaughter or\\nhomicide, it would still be safer to wait for the police. If\\nI were to leave and try to avoid police involvement, I\\'d be committing\\nseveral felonies and ruining my chances of claiming self-defence\\nin court (\"If it really was self-defence,\" the prosecuter would\\nask, \"why did you run away and hide from the police?\")\\n\\nIn other states, however, this decision might not be so clear-cut:\\nIf someone in, say, Washington D.C. were to use a gun in self-defence\\nhe would _automatically_ be guilty of several felony violations of\\nthat city\\'s gun control laws. Such a person\\'s choices would be\\nbetween certain conviction for a couple of felonies versus possible\\nconviction for half a dozen.

When I look at\\nJesus in the garden, I see a Man-God, who all His life had had the\\npresense of His Father with Him.  As a result, He knew every\\ndetail about His death long before the Agony in the Garden.  But\\nas that hour approached, He felt abandoned by His Father, His\\npresense diminishing with each passing minute.  In addition, it\\nwas brought more and more to Jesus\\'s attention (the betrayal of\\nJudas was probably a big impact) that His suffering would be to no\\navail for many people, especially those who would reject Him, not\\nonly then but in the future.  I truly believe that the majority of\\nJesus\\'s suffering was mental and spiritual, while the physical\\nportion was only the tip of the iceburg.\\n\\nBTW, we know from John\\'s account that Jesus *shunned* becomming an earthly\\nking.  From John:\\n\\nJOH 6:14    After the people saw the miraculous sign that Jesus did, they\\n            began to say, \"Surely this is the Prophet who is to come into the\\n            world.\"\\nJOH 6:15    Jesus, knowing that they intended to come and make him king by\\n            force, withdrew again to a mountain by himself.\\n\\nThis does not seem like a man who would regret not becoming an\\nearthly king.  No, Jesus knew His mission was to redeem all (Jew &\\nGentile) people and establish His kingdom in the hearts of those\\nwho would believe.  This was utterly mistaken, much to Jesus\\'s\\ndismay, as an aspiration to some earthly kingdom.  But He knew\\nwhat His Father\\'s will was and followed it obediently even in the\\ndarkness of His Passion.\\n',\n  '\\nThe \"so sacred it\\'s secret\" explanation is a bit misleading.  While\\nthere is a profound reverence for the temple endowment, there is no\\ninjunction against discussing the ceremony itself in public.  But\\nsince public discussion is often irreverent, most Mormons would rather\\nkeep silent than have a cherished practice maligned.\\n\\nBut there are certain elements of the ceremony which participants\\nexplicitly covenant not to reveal except in conjunction with the\\nceremony itself.\\n\\n\\nThere are other interpretations to Christian history in this matter.\\nOne must recall that most of what we know about the Gnostics was\\nwritten by their enemies.  Eusebius claims that Jesus imparted secret\\ninformation to Peter, James, and John after His resurrection, and that\\nthose apostles transmitted that information to the rest of the Twelve\\n(Eusebius, _Historia Ecclesiastica_ II 1:3-4).\\n\\nIrenaeus claims this information was passed on to the priests and\\nbishops (_Against Heresies_ IV 33:8), but Eusebius disagrees.  He\\nclaims the secret ceremonies of the Christian church perished with the\\napostles.  Interestingly enough, Eusebius refers to the groups which\\nwe today call Gnostics as promulgators of a false gnosis (Eusebius,\\nop. cit., III, 32:7-8).  His gripe was not that thay professed *a*\\ngnosis, but that they had the *wrong* one.\\n\\nWritings dealing with Jesus\\' post-resurrection teachings emphasize\\nsecrecy -- not so much a concealment as a policy of not teaching\\ncertain things indiscriminately.  In one story, Simon Magus opens a\\ndialog with Peter on the nature of God.  Peter\\'s response is \"You seem\\nto me not to know what a father and a God is: But I could tell you\\nboth whence souls are, and when and how they were made; but it is not\\npermitted to me now to disclose these things to you\" (_Clementine\\nRecognitions_ II, 60).  If any one theme underlies the _Recognitions_\\nit is the idea that certain doctrines are not to be idly taught, but\\ncan be had after a certain level of spiritual maturity is reached.\\n\\nNow one can approach this and other such evidence in many ways.  I\\ndon\\'t intend that everyone interpret Christian history as I do, but I\\nbelieve that evidence exists (favorably interpreted, of course) of\\nearly Christian rites analogous to those practiced by Mormons today.\\n\\n\\nBut if Judaism and Christianity had such ceremonies, would you expect\\nto read about them in public documents?  One can search the Book of\\nMormon and other Mormon scripture and find almost no information on\\ntemple worship.  Yes, you could establish that Mormons worship in\\ntemples, but you would probably be hard pressed to characterize that\\nworship.  On that basis, can we conclude that the Bible explains *all*\\npractices which might have taken place, and that absence of such\\ndescriptions proves they did not exist?\\n\\nMormon scholar Dr. Hugh Nibley offers us a list of scriptures from\\nwhich I have taken a few:\\n\\n1. \"It is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of\\nheaven, but to them it is not given\" (Matt. 13:11).\\n\\n2. \"All men cannot receive this saying, save they to whom it is given\"\\n(Matt. 19:11).\\n\\n3. \"I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them\\nnow\" (John 16:12).\\n\\n4. \"The time cometh, when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs,\\nbut I shall shew you plainly of the Father\" (John 16:25).\\n\\n5. \"... unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter\"\\n(1 Cor. 3:1-2).\\n\\n6. \"Many things ... I would not write with paper and ink; but I ...\\ncome unto you and speak face to face\" (2 Jn. 1:12).\\n\\n(Nibley, _Since Cumorah_, pp. 92-94)\\n\\nAgain, these can also be interpreted many different ways.  I believe\\nthey serve to show that not all doctrines which could have been taught\\nwere actually taught openly.\\n\\n\\nHistorically, Joseph Smith had been adiministering the temple\\nendowment ceremony for nearly a year before joining the Freemasons.\\nThere is diary evidence which supports a claim that the rite did not\\nchange after Smith became a Mason.  It can be argued that Smith had\\nample exposure to Masonic proceedings through the burlesque of his\\ntime and through his brother Hyrum (a Mason), though no specific\\nconnection has yet been established.\\n\\nMy conversations with Masons (with respect to temple rite\\ntranscriptions which have appeared on the net) have led me to believe\\nthat the connection from Masonry to Mormonism is fairly tenuous.  As\\nour moderator notes, most of what was similar was removed in the\\nrecent revisions to the temple ceremony.  I believe that critics who\\ncharge that Mormon rites were lifted from Freemasonry do not have\\nadequate knowledge of the rites in question.\\n-- \\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n         Jay Windley  *  University of Utah  *  Salt Lake City\\n                    jwindley@asylum.cs.utah.edu',\n  'I was in the great storm.....my Mazda MPV was damaged so bad they are \\ngoing to replace the top, doors and hood.

Advantages include the fact\\n    that I can later add the pants, and that it nearly eliminates\\n    the need for the jacket portion of a rainsuit.\\n\\n2)  Buy some kind of leather jacket.  I like a few of the new \\n    Hein-Gericke FirstGear line, however they may be a bit pricey\\n    unless I can work some sort of deal.  Advantages of leather\\n    are potentially slightly better protection, enhanced pose\\n    value (we all know how important that is :-), possibly cheaper\\n    than upper Aerostich.\\n\\nRequirements for a jacket are that it must fit over a few other \\nlayers (mainly a sizing thing), if leather i'd prefer a zip-out \\nlining, it MUST have some body armor similar to aerostich (elbows, \\nshoulders, forearms, possibly back/kidney protection, etc.), a \\nreasonable amount of pocket space would be nice, ventilation would \\nbe a plus, however it must be wearable in cold weather (below\\nfreezing) with layers or perhaps electrics.\\n\\nPlease fire away with suggestions, comments, etc...\\n\\nSteve\\n--\",\n  \"I had a catalog with membrane keypads, but I dunno what\\nhappened to it, and it was so long ago that I forget the\\nname of the company.

It\\n(this FAQ, not RIPEM) was written and will be maintained by Marc\\nVanHeyningen, &lt;mvanheyn@whale.cs.indiana.edu&gt;.  It will be posted to a\\nvariety of newsgroups on a monthly basis; follow-up discussion specific\\nto RIPEM is redirected to the group alt.security.ripem.\\n\\nThis month, I have reformatted this posting in an attempt to comply\\nwith the standards for HyperText FAQ formatting to allow easy\\nmanipulation of this document over the World Wide Web.  Let me know\\nwhat you think.\\n\\nDISCLAIMER\\n----------\\nNothing in this FAQ should be considered legal advice, or anything\\nother than one person\\'s opinion.  If you want real legal advice, talk\\nto a real lawyer.\\n\\nQUESTIONS AND ANSWERS\\n---------------------\\n\\n1)  What is RIPEM?\\n\\n RIPEM is a program which performs Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM) using\\n the cryptographic techniques of RSA and DES.  It allows your\\n electronic mail to have the properties of authentication (i.e. who\\n sent it can be confirmed) and privacy (i.e. nobody can read it except\\n the intended recipient.)\\n\\n RIPEM was written primarily by Mark Riordan &lt;mrr@scss3.cl.msu.edu&gt;.\\n Most of the code is in the public domain, except for the RSA routines,\\n which are a library called RSAREF licensed from RSA Data Security Inc.\\n\\n2)  How can I get RIPEM?\\n\\n RIPEM contains the library of cryptographic routines RSAREF, which is\\n considered munitions and thus is export-restricted from distribution\\n to people who are not citizens or permanent residents of the U.S. or\\n Canada.  Therefore, the following request is quoted from the README\\n file:\\n\\n #Please do not export the cryptographic code in this distribution\\n #outside of the USA or Canada.  This is a personal request from me,\\n #the author of RIPEM, and a condition of your use of RIPEM.\\n\\n Note that RSAREF is not in the public domain, and a license for it is\\n included with the distribution.  You should read it before using\\n RIPEM.\\n\\n The best way to get it is to ask a friend for a copy, since this will\\n reduce the load on those sites that do carry it (not to mention the\\n humans that run them.)  Naturally this requires that you trust the\\n friend.\\n\\n RIPEM is available via anonymous FTP to citizens and permanent residents\\n in the U.S. from rsa.com; cd to rsaref/ and read the README file for\\n info.  Last I looked, this site contains only the source tree, and\\n does not contain compiled binaries or the nice Mac version.\\n\\n RIPEM, as well as some other crypt stuff, has its \"home site\" on\\n rpub.cl.msu.edu, which is open to non-anonymous FTP for users in the\\n U.S. and Canada who are citizens or permanent residents.  To find out\\n how to obtain access, ftp there, cd to pub/crypt/, and read the file\\n GETTING_ACCESS.  For convenience, binaries for many architectures are\\n available here in addition to the full source tree.\\n\\n3)  Will RIPEM run on my machine?\\n\\n Probably.  It has already been ported to MS-DOS and most flavors of\\n Unix (SunOS, NeXT, Linux, AIX, ULTRIX, Solaris, etc.)  Ports to\\n Macintosh include a standard UNIX-style port and a rather nice\\n Mac-like port written by Raymond Lau, author of StuffIt.  More ports\\n are expected, and help of users is invited.\\n\\n4)  Will RIPEM work with my mailer?\\n\\n Probably.  How easy and clean the effective interface is will depend\\n on the sophistication and modularity of the mailer, though.  The users\\n guide, included with the distribution, discusses ways to use RIPEM\\n with many popular mailers, including Berkeley, mush, Elm, and MH.\\n Code is also included in elisp to allow easy use of RIPEM inside GNU\\n Emacs.\\n\\n If you make a new interface for RIPEM or create an improvement on one\\n in the distribution which you believe is convenient to use, secure,\\n and may be useful to others, feel free to post it to alt.security.ripem.\\n\\n5)  What is RSA?\\n\\n RSA is a crypto system which is asymmetric, or public-key.  This means\\n that there are two different, related keys: one to encrypt and one to\\n decrypt.  Because one cannot (reasonably) be derived from the other,\\n you may publish your encryption, or public key widely and keep your\\n decryption, or private key to yourself.  Anyone can use your public\\n key to encrypt a message, but only you hold the private key needed to\\n decrypt it.  (Note that the \"message\" sent with RSA is normally just\\n the DES key to the real message. (See \"What is DES?\")\\n\\n Note that the above only provides for privacy.  For authentication,\\n the fingerprint of the message (See \"What is a fingerprint, like\\n MD5?\") is encrypted with the sender\\'s private key.  The recipient can\\n use the sender\\'s public key to decrypt it and confirm that the message\\n must have come from the sender.\\n\\n RSA was named for the three men (Rivest, Shamir and Adleman) who\\n invented it.  To find out more about RSA, ftp to rsa.com and look in\\n pub/faq/ or look in sci.crypt.\\n\\n6)  What is DES?\\n\\n DES is the Data Encryption Standard, a widely used symmetric, or\\n secret-key, crypto system.  Unlike RSA, DES uses the same key to\\n encrypt and decrypt messages.  However, DES is much faster than RSA.\\n\\n RIPEM uses both DES and RSA; it generates a random key and encrypts\\n your mail with DES using that key.  It then encrypts that key with the\\n recipient\\'s public RSA key and includes the result in the letter,\\n allowing the recipient to recover the DES key.\\n\\n DES is sometimes considered weak because it is somewhat old and uses a\\n key length considered too short by modern standards.  However, it\\n should be reasonably safe against an opponent smaller than a large\\n corporation or government agency.  It is not unlikely that future\\n RIPEMs will strengthen the symmetric cipher, possibly by using\\n multiple encryption with DES.\\n\\n7)  What is PEM, and how does RIPEM relate?\\n\\n PEM is Privacy Enhanced Mail, a system for allowing easy transfer of\\n encrypted electronic mail.  It is described in RFCs 1421-1424; these\\n documents have been approved and obsolete the old RFCs 1113-1115.\\n\\n RIPEM is not really a complete implementation of PEM, because PEM\\n specifies certificates for authenticating keys, which RIPEM does not\\n handle at this time.  Their addition is planned.\\n\\n8)  What\\'s this about distributing and authenticating keys?\\n\\n For a remote user to be able to send secure mail to you, she must know\\n your public key.  For you to be able to confirm that the message\\n received came from her, you must know her public key.  It is important\\n that this information be accurate; if a \"bad guy\" convinces her that\\n his key is in fact yours, she will send messages which he can read.\\n\\n RIPEM allows for three methods of key management: a central server,\\n the distributed finger servers, and a flat file.  All three are\\n described in the RIPEM users guide which is part of the distribution.\\n None of them provide perfect security.\\n\\n9)  Why do all RIPEM public keys look very similar?\\n\\n RIPEM public keys begin with a PKCS identifier describing various\\n characteristics about the key, so the first bunch of characters in\\n your key may be the same as those of lots of other people\\'s keys.\\n This does not mean your keys are similar, but only that they are the\\n same class of key, were generated with the same program, are of the\\n same length, etc.\\n\\n10)  What is a fingerprint, like MD5?\\n\\n MD5 is a message digest algorithm produced by RSA Data Security Inc.\\n It provides a 128-bit fingerprint, or cryptographically secure hash,\\n of the plaintext.  It is cryptographically secure because it is not\\n possible (in a reasonable amount of computation) to produce a\\n different plaintext which produces the same fingerprint.  Thus,\\n instead of signing the entire message with the sender\\'s private key,\\n only the MD5 of the message needs to be signed for authentication.\\n\\n MD5 is sometimes used for other purposes; for example, it is often\\n used to map an input of arbitrary length to 128 bits of data, as a\\n passphrase interpreter or cookie generator.\\n\\n MD5 is described in its entirety (including an implementation in C) in\\n RFC 1321.\\n\\n11)  What is PGP?\\n\\n PGP is another cryptographic mail program called Pretty Good Privacy.\\n PGP has been around longer than RIPEM, and works somewhat differently.\\n PGP is not compatible with RIPEM in any way, though PGP does also use RSA.\\n\\n Some major differences between PGP and RIPEM:\\n\\n - PGP has more key management features, particularly for users without\\n   a direct network connection.\\n\\n - RIPEM conforms to the PEM RFCs and thus has a greater probability of\\n   working with other PEM software.  PGP makes no attempt to be compatible\\n   with anything other than PGP (in fact, PGP 1.0 is not compatible with\\n   PGP 2.0.)\\n\\n - RIPEM uses RSAREF, a library of RSA routines from RSA Data Security\\n   Inc.  RSAREF comes with a license which allows noncommercial use.\\n   PGP uses its own implementation of RSA which is not licensed; thus,\\n   PKP, the firm holding the U.S. patents on the RSA algorithm, claims\\n   that it is a infringement of that patent to make, use or sell PGP in\\n   the U.S. or Canada.  In acknowledgement of this, PGP\\'s original\\n   author, Phil Zimmermann, says in the documentation:\\n\\n   #In fact, if you live in the USA, and you are not a Federal agency, \\n   #you shouldn\\'t actually run PGP on your computer, because Public\\n   #Key Partners wants to forbid you from running my software.  PGP is\\n   #contraband.  \\n\\n - Both PGP and RIPEM are export-restricted, and cannot be sent outside\\n   the U.S. and Canada.  However, PGP already exists on many ftp sites\\n   in Europe and other places.\\n\\n Whether you use PGP or RIPEM or whatever, the documentation to PGP is\\n recommended reading to anyone interested in such issues.\\n\\n Note that the above facts, both regarding patent and export\\n restrictions, are somewhat controversial; many people think it\\n shouldn\\'t be that way, and some people interpret various documents\\n differently.  Unfortunately, discussions of it on the net inevitably\\n seem to produce more heat than light, and probably belong in\\n misc.legal.computing.  (See:  \"DISCLAIMER\")\\n\\n12)  What about RPEM?\\n\\n RPEM stands for Rabin Privacy Enhanced Mail.  It was similar to RIPEM,\\n but used a public-key cipher invented by Rabin (which is not RSA) in\\n an attempt to avoid the patent on RSA.  It was written by Mark\\n Riordan, the same author as RIPEM.\\n\\n Its distribution was halted when, contrary to the beliefs of many\\n (including Rabin), Public Key Partners (PKP) claimed that their patent\\n was broad enough to cover any public-key cipher whose strength rested\\n in the difficulty of factoring products of large primes, not just RSA.\\n This claim is not universally accepted by any means, but was not\\n challenged for pragmatic reasons.\\n\\n RPEM is not really used anymore.  It is not compatible with RIPEM or PGP.\\n\\n13)  What is MIME?\\n\\n MIME stands for Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions, and is\\n described in RFC 1341.  You can find out about it in the newsgroup\\n comp.mail.mime.  How PEM should interact with MIME is not yet entirely\\n clear; some people use the stopgap solution of having a MIME type\\n application/x-ripem in order to send RIPEM messages as MIME ones.  I\\n hope some standards will emerge.  Draft Internet documents exist on\\n the matter.\\n\\n14)  I have this simple way to defeat the security of RIPEM...',\n  \"\\nIf you want to live with someone, you can.\\nIf you don't want to have a civil marriage, don't.\\nIf you don't want to have a wedding in a church, don't.\\nIf you want to call that a marriage, go right ahead.\\n\\nI hope that the young people that are around you, don't follow your example.\\n\\n\",\n  '\\n\\nLarry:\\n\\nThe subject content IS serious; as is the question.\\n\\nOn one hand you state that \"things have changed dramatically\" but, at the\\nsame time nothing you \"can think of has changed\".

I can\\'t help but wonder what would happen if all\\nviolence against Israelis stopped.  Hopefully, violence against Arabs\\nwould stop at the same time.

What practical \\ndifference can this make?\",\n  'This kind of argument cries for a comment...\\n\\n\\n \\n: &gt;&gt;...God did not create\\n: &gt;&gt;disease nor is He responsible for the maladies of newborns.\\n: &gt; \\n: &gt;&gt;What God did create was life according to a protein code which is\\n: &gt;&gt;mutable and can evolve.  Without delving into a deep discussion of\\n: &gt;&gt;creationism vs evolutionism, God created the original genetic code\\n: &gt;&gt;perfect and without flaw. \\n: &gt;  ~~~~~~~     ~~~~~~~ ~~~~\\n\\nDo you have any evidence for this? If the code was once perfect, and\\nhas degraded ever since, we _should_ have some evidence in favour\\nof this statement, shouldn\\'t we?\\n\\nPerhaps the biggest \"imperfection\" of the code is that it is full\\nof non-coding regions, introns, which are so called because they\\nintervene with the coding regions (exons). An impressive amount of\\nevidence suggests that introns are of very ancient origin; it is\\nlikely that early exons represented early protein domains.\\n\\nIs the number of introns decreasing or increasing? It appears that\\nintron loss can occur, and species with common ancestry usually\\nhave quite similar exon-intron structure in their genes. \\n\\nOn the other hand, the possibility that introns have been inserted\\nlater, presents several logical difficulties. Introns are removed\\nby a splicing mechanism - this would have to be present, but unused,\\nif introns are inserted. Moreover, intron insertion would have\\nrequired _precise_ targeting - random insertion would not be tolerated,\\nsince sequences for intron removal (self-splicing of mRNA) are\\nconserved. Besides, transposition of a sequence usually leaves a\\ntrace - long terminal repeats and target - site duplications, and\\nthese are not found in or near intron sequences. \\n\\nI seriously recommend reading textbooks on molecular biology and\\ngenetics before posting \"theological arguments\" like this. \\nTry Watson\\'s Molecular Biology of the Gene or Darnell, Lodish\\n& Baltimore\\'s Molecular Biology of the Cell for starters.\\n\\n: Remember, the question was posed in a theological context (Why does\\n: God cause disease in newborns?), and my answer is likewise from a\\n: theological perspective -- my own.  It is no less valid than a purely\\n: scientific perspective, just different.\\n\\nScientific perspective is supported by the evidence, whereas \\ntheological perspectives often fail to fulfil this criterion.\\n \\n: I think you misread my meaning.  I said God made the genetic code perfect,\\n: but that doesn\\'t mean it\\'s perfect now.  It has certainly evolved since.\\n\\nFor the worse? Would you please cite a few references that support\\nyour assertion? Your assertion is less valid than the scientific\\nperspective, unless you support it by some evidence.\\n\\nIn fact, it has been claimed that parasites and diseases are perhaps\\nmore important than we\\'ve thought - for instance, sex might\\nhave evolved as defence against parasites. (This view is supported by\\ncomputer simulations of evolution, eg Tierra.) \\n \\n: Perhaps.  I thought it was higher energy rays like X-rays, gamma\\n: rays, and cosmic rays that caused most of the damage.\\n\\nIn fact, it is thermal energy that does most of the damage, although\\nit is usually mild and easily fixed by enzymatic action. \\n\\n: Actually, neither of us \"knows\" what the atmosphere was like at the\\n: time when God created life.  According to my recollection, most\\n: biologists do not claim that life began 4 billion years ago -- after\\n: all, that would only be a half billion years or so after the earth\\n: was created.  It would still be too primitive to support life.  I\\n: seem to remember a figure more like 2.5 to 3 billion years ago for\\n: the origination of life on earth.  Anyone with a better estimate?\\n\\nI\\'d replace \"created\" with \"formed\", since there is no need to \\ninvoke any creator if the Earth can be formed without one.\\nMost recent estimates of the age of the Earth range between 4.6 - 4.8\\nbillion years, and earliest signs of life (not true fossils, but\\norganic, stromatolite-like layers) date back to 3.5 billion years.\\nThis would leave more than billion years for the first cells to\\nevolve.\\n\\nI\\'m sorry I can\\'t give any references, this is based on the course\\non evolutionary biochemistry I attended here. \\n\\n: &gt;&gt;dominion, it was no great feat for Satan to genetically engineer\\n: &gt;&gt;diseases, both bacterial/viral and genetic.  Although the forces of\\n: &gt;&gt;natural selection tend to improve the survivability of species, the\\n: &gt;&gt;degeneration of the genetic code tends to more than offset this.  \\n\\nAgain, do you _want_ this be true, or do you have any evidence for\\nthis supposed \"degeneration\"? \\n\\nI can understand Scott\\'s reaction:\\n\\n: &gt; Excuse me, but this is so far-fetched that I know you must be\\n: &gt; jesting.

Do you have evidence against\\nthis conclusion? In science, one does not have to _believe_ in \\nanything. It is a healthy sign to doubt and disbelieve. But the \\nright path to walk is to take a look at the evidence if you do so,\\nand not to present one\\'s own conclusions prior to this. \\n\\nTheology does not use this method. Therefore, I seriously doubt\\nit could ever come to right conclusions.\\n\\n: &gt;&gt;Human DNA, being more \"complex\", tends to accumulate errors adversely\\n: &gt;&gt;affecting our well-being and ability to fight off disease, while the \\n: &gt;&gt;simpler DNA of bacteria and viruses tend to become more efficient in \\n: &gt;&gt;causing infection and disease.  It is a bad combination.  Hence\\n: &gt;&gt;we have newborns that suffer from genetic, viral, and bacterial\\n: &gt;&gt;diseases/disorders.\\n\\nYou are supposing a purpose, not a valid move. Bacteria and viruses\\ndo not exist to cause disease. They are just another manifests of\\na general principle of evolution - only replication saves replicators\\nfrom degradiation. We are just an efficient method for our DNA to \\nsurvive and replicate. The less efficient methods didn\\'t make it \\nto the present. \\n\\nAnd for the last time.  Please present some evidence for your claim that\\nhuman DNA is degrading through evolutionary processes. Some people have\\nclaimed that the opposite is true - we have suppressed our selection,\\nand thus are bound to degrade. I haven\\'t seen much evidence for either\\nclaim.\\n \\n: But then I ask, So?  Where is this relevant to my discussion in\\n: answering John\\'s question of why?  Why are there genetic diseases,\\n: and why are there so many bacterial and viral diseases which require\\n: babies to develop antibodies.  Is it God\\'s fault? (the original\\n: question) -- I say no, it is not.\\n\\nOf course, nothing \"evil\" is god\\'s fault.  But your explanation does\\nnot work, it fails miserably.\\n \\n: You may be right.  But the fact is that you don\\'t know that\\n: Satan is not responsible, and neither do I.\\n: \\n: Suppose that a powerful, evil being like Satan exists.  Would it\\n: be inconceivable that he might be responsible for many of the ills\\n: that affect mankind?  I don\\'t think so.\\n\\nHe could have done a much better Job. (Pun intended.) The problem is,\\nit seems no Satan is necessary to explain any diseases, they are\\njust as inevitable as any product of evolution.\\n\\n: Did I say that?  Where?  Seems to me like another bad inference.\\n: Actually what you\\'ve done is to oversimplify what I said to the\\n: point that your summary of my words takes on a new context.  I\\n: never said that people are \"meant\" (presumably by God) \"to be\\n: punished by getting diseases\".  Why I did say is that free moral\\n: choices have attendent consequences.  If mankind chooses to reject\\n: God, as people have done since the beginning, then they should not\\n: expect God to protect them from adverse events in an entropic\\n: universe.\\n\\nI am not expecting this. If god exists, I expect him to leave us alone.\\nI would also like to hear why do you believe your choices are indeed\\nfree.

This is why we recommend\\nthese books.\\n\\nIs there any need to invoke any why behind, a prime mover? Evidence\\nfor this? If the whole universe can come into existence without\\nany intervention, as recent cosmological theories (Hawking et al)\\nsuggest, why do people still insist on this?\\n \\n: Thanks Scotty, for your fine and sagely advice.

From a theological bent, those who lived\\nimmediately after the flood, such as Noah, Ham, his son Cush, and his son\\nNimrod had a much stronger appreciation of Divine wrath.  They also had a\\nstronger understanding of the True God.  In fact, this immediacy was a cause of\\nhardship for some, so much so that Atlas, who is seen with heavens resting on\\nhis shoulders.  But this is not merely the physical heavens that he is lifting.\\n It is to put God and the strict spirituality of His law at a distance, and\\nthus he became the \"Elevator of the heavens.\"  This \"god\" made men able to\\n\"feel\" as if heaven were afar off and \"as if either the God of Heaven could not\\nsee through the dark cloud, or did not regard with displeasure the breakers of\\nHis laws.\"  It is interesting to see that it was that was titled \"Emancipator\"\\nor \"Deliverer\"  or Phoroneus. It was Nimrod who invaded the patriarchal system\\nand abridged the liberties of mankind, yet was worship for having given many\\nbenefits.  He was a deliverer all right but not as we think of Christ as a\\nDeliverer.  One delivered from a conscious feeling of God\\'s wrath, the other\\nactually performed a delivery from Gods wrath and it is up to us to accept it\\nas true.\\n\\n\\nI don\\'t see the problem.  From the time of Adam, those who looked forward to\\nthe coming \"Anointed One\" and put their faith in the fact that it was God who\\nwas to do the provision, were accounted as righteous.  But up to the\\nCrucifixion, their sins were only covered, not taken away.  Therefore, the\\ndispensation of the Church views the accountability of sin the same, but see it\\nas a completed action.  Rom\\'s makes it clear that it has always been salvation\\nvia faith and nothing else.\\n\\n\\nI understand what you\\'re trying to convey, but I don\\'t think I\\'d lay hold of it\\nbecause the scriptures do equate the eternality of the second death with the\\neternality of, say the Church ruling with Christ.  Jn 17 tells us what eternal\\nlife is exactly, as you are correct that it is much more than non-cessation of\\nconsciousness.  \\n\\n\\nIt depends upon your def of \"lost.\"  The elect were lost only in time as\\noutside of time they had been chosen from the foundation of the world. \\nExistentially we were all born \"lost\", but the \"righteous\" were \"in Christ\" and\\ntherefore never *assuredly* lost.  \\n\\nMaybe this summer I could find time to put together a paper on it.

This was my point.\\n\\n\\nAh!  This is it.  This is the big question.

That is why it is so hard to bring their teachings\\nto light. The \"Mystery of Iniquity\" that we find in the Bible, correlates to\\nthis I think.  The primary object of the mysteries was to introduce privately,\\nlittle by little, under the seal of secrecy and sanction of oath, what it would\\nnot have been safe to openly profess was the true religion.

So, let\\'s say that a team has a record of 38 wins, 36 losses, and 10\\nties.  Another team has a record of 40 wins, 38 losses and 6 ties.  The\\nfirst team has (38*2)+10 = 86 points.

He\\n(Weatherhead) also refuted the last statement (above) by Michael\\nParkin above quite nicely.\\n\\nSummarizing; _despite_ the failures of humankind, God\\'s ultimate will\\nis never to be defeated.  God\\'s intentions may be interfered with,\\neven temporarily defeated by the will of humankind, brought down by\\ncircumstance.  His ultimate will (the reconcilication of all\\nhumankind) will never be stopped.\\n\\nTime after time, Weatherhead used the Cross as the best description of\\nthis process at work.  His points, paraphrased, were 1) God\\'s\\nintentional will was for Jesus, the Christ, to live out a full life\\nand perform the work of the Living God.  2) The failures, sins, and\\ndeviousness of humankind frustrated God\\'s intent for His Son.  3)\\nDespite the circumstance, God\\'s ultimate will was revealed in the\\nCross, as Jesus willingly (\"not my will, Lord, but yours\") died for\\nthe redemption of all humankind.  The Cross was utterly triumphant,\\novercoming even the most cruel of circumstances.\\n\\n\\nIt was not the intentional will of God.  It was the circumstancial\\nwill, thus enabling the victory of the ultimate will.\\n\\n\\n\\nRight, intentional will.\\n\\n(Just like the Jewish people\\n\\nWe know neither the time nor the place.

While you are probably correct that 400%\\ndoes not mean 4 more wins then losses, it means something.  I would\\nrather have a player who increased my teams chances of winning by 1% in\\neach of 400 PAs then I would a player who increased my chances of winning\\nby .5% in each of 400 PAs.  Thus, there appears to me to be an obvious\\npositive association between John\\'s statistic and winning games.  Thus,\\nbefore you disregard this stat, it appears to me that further study must\\ngo into what sort of relationship there is.\\n\\n\\nThe only problem here is an insistance that these number mean exactly\\nhow many wins the team has.  First, we are using averages over many\\nseasons and applying them to one game.  Second, remember some players\\nperformance take away from the chance of you winning.  That is a\\nplayer who gets an out gets a \"negative probability\" in most cases.\\nThus, I\\'m not sure in any given game when you add up all the numbers\\nfor a team who won that they will add up to 1 in that game.  Sometimes,\\nthey will add up to more then one sometime, less than one.  Also,\\nthe pitchers\\' bad performances (giving up 6 runs) may have given\\nthem a large negative percentage for that game.  Also, any batter that\\npulled an 0-4 night would give large negatives.  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNo, but really only because you have a smaller sample size.  I would\\nthink however, that the number of runs you score in the first inning\\nwould be just as good as a prediction as how many runs you score \\nin the last inning.  And, realize something else a closer usually\\ncomes in in a close situation, not a blow out.  It is hard to argue\\nthat any runs that a closer gives up in a game have equal importance\\nto those given up in the first inning.  Look, a closer giving up runs\\noften means a team will lose many games.  On, the other hand a starter\\nwho gives up runs often still leaves his team a chance to win.  The\\noffence has many more outs to do something about.  But, I am not\\nsaying all late inning situations are equally important either.  If\\nI am down 8 runs in the ninth, it really does not matter how many\\nruns my pitcher gives up in the ninth.       \\n\\n\\n\\nNo, but why would you assume that the teams probability of winning would\\nbe 0 before the possesion in which the free throws were made.  Look,\\nif you are down 1 point with 5 seconds left, there is a fairly high\\nprobability that you will win the game if you are in possesion of the\\nball.  And, do not forget that somebody elses missed shots, turnovers,\\nfouls, bad defense, etc. caused a \"negative chance\" that the team\\nwould win.\\n \\nFrom reading all of the discussion on this statistic, I feel that those\\nwho critisize it to a certain extent are doing so out of an agenda.\\nAt first look this statistic valadates clutchness.  But, it really\\ndoes not.  Cluthness revolves around the idea that certain players\\nin crucial situation elevate their performance and others performance\\ngoes down.  I\\'ve never seen convincing proof that this really happens.\\nSo, if you assume there is no clutchness, then that means that except\\nfor a lot of noice, this statistic has a positive association to\\nplayer performance.  There is a way to get rid of the noice if you\\ndo not believe in clutchness.  Certainly, we could find out what\\nthe average value of a home run is for example.  We may find for\\ninstance, that a home run increases your chance of winning by 15%\\non average while a strikeout decreases your chance of winning by 5%.\\nI bet if this were done we would find that this statistic was just\\nas good as other statistics we have for predicting wins and losses.\\n\\nHow do we evaluate relief pitchers?  Say John and Sam have the\\nexact same pitching statistics (runs, earned runs, K\\'s, BB\\'s,\\netc.)  Both had exceptional numbers.  John, however only pitched\\nin closer situations, while Sam was a Mop up man.  Who was more\\nvaluble to their team?  Probably John.  Who was the better \\npitcher?  They were probably about the same.',\n  '[Please excuse me if this is inappropriate to post here, but I do not read  \\nthese groups normally and I did not see any PC related marketplace  \\nnewsgroups]\\n\\nFOR SALE: Borland C++ with Application Frameworks 3.1 (Full Professional  \\nDeveloper Kit)\\n\\nBorland C++ Programming Package including unopened software, unopened  \\nmanuals, and registration card.\\n\\nSOFTWARE INCLUDES:\\n1. *Still plastic wrapped* high density 5.25 inch disks for Borland C++:\\n\\ttotal of 18 diskettes in 2 individually wrapped packages, each\\n\\tdisk has \"Borland C++\" and \"BC++ & APP.

They are essentially\\ndouble conversion transverters with digital mod and demod at 29 MHz.\\nThe receiver uses the MC13055 which is the same FSK receiver chip I used\\npreviouslyu in the 2 Mbps 10 GHz data link I first published in Ham\\nRadio and which is now also in the ARRL handbook.\\n\\n  The MC3356, which includes a VHF converter section, could also be used\\nat these speeds.  There is a newer and perhaps slightly improved design\\nof this (the MC13056 if I remember rightly).\\n\\n  While using this would have let me reduce the \"external\" IF count on\\nreceive, it didn\\'t really offer all that much help on transmit so I\\ndidn\\'t bother with it.\\n\\n  The radios I built were first designed and built for 512 kbps in a 2\\nMHz channel but later reduced to half that.  These 256 kbps radios\\nactually have done quite well in across-the-bench tests at 384 kbps and\\nspeed is pretty much a function of filter design.  Handling the data\\nstream is another matter entirely.\\n\\n  Some of the existing radios are currently deployed on hilltops in a\\n\"beacon\" test mode.  While there is not yet end-end two-way data flow\\ndue to lack of resources to debug software for the digital hardware (MIO\\nalso shown in the CNC proceedings), data is perfect copy at n6gn.  Even\\nthough the data clock is currently at about half speed, the a 2+ kbytes\\nof the test text (chapter 55 of Isaiah) takes only a little over 1/8 of\\na second.\\n\\n  I\\'ve been hoping that someone would get interested enough to step in\\nand get involved in writing code to make the whole thing usable (Borland\\nIDE environment with remote debugging possible as mentioned in the\\nproceedings) but to date a couple of us have been on our own and running\\nlow on resources of time, money and energy.\\n\\n  If anyone in the SF bay area wants to check it out there is also a CW\\nID after the text on the mark side at 904.740 MHz from beacons on Sonoma\\nMtn and Black Mtn (overlooking Si valley).  The antenna is horizontally\\npolarized.\\n\\n  I guess in retrospect my suggestions are that this is a fairly costly\\napproach if the radios are intended for users rather than backbones and\\nyou might want to carefully consider your \"target\".  If you can\\'t\\narrange your paths such that you have complete line-of-sight I think\\nyou\\'ll want to address the inter-symbol-interference caused by\\nmultipath and probably link C/N budgets if paths are very far from LOS.\\nFor more details, see the 10th CNC.

The stud is mounted on the footpeg by a threaded bit about 7\\nmm long, which screws into a threaded hole in the footpeg.  Now for the\\nmystery.\\n\\nThe stud on the side of the bike that clunked when I turned was absent.  I\\'m\\nfairly sure it was there before the event.  There was no damage to the end of\\nthe footpeg where the stud would ordinarily have been.  In fact, the thread in\\nthe hole in the footpeg was perfectly intact, with no evidence of something\\nhaving been forcefully ripped out of it only moments previously.  \\n\\nOkay all you engineering types, how the f**k do you explain this ?

Cryptography? Plaintext? Ciphertext? Encryption? Key?\\n\\n  The story begins: When Julius Caesar sent messages to his trusted\\n  acquaintances, he didn't trust the messengers. So he replaced every A\\n  by a C, every B by a D, and so on through the alphabet. Only someone\\n  who knew the ``shift by 2'' rule could decipher his messages.\\n\\n  A cryptosystem or cipher system is a method of disguising messages so\\n  that only certain people can see through the disguise. Cryptography is\\n  the art of creating and using cryptosystems. Cryptanalysis is the art\\n  of breaking cryptosystems---seeing through the disguise even when\\n  you're not supposed to be able to. Cryptology is the study of both\\n  cryptography and cryptanalysis.\\n\\n  The original message is called a plaintext. The disguised message is\\n  called a ciphertext. Encryption means any procedure to convert\\n  plaintext into ciphertext. Decryption means any procedure to convert\\n  ciphertext into plaintext.\\n\\n  A cryptosystem is usually a whole collection of algorithms. The\\n  algorithms are labelled; the labels are called keys. For instance,\\n  Caesar probably used ``shift by n'' encryption for several different\\n  values of n. It's natural to say that n is the key here.\\n\\n  The people who are supposed to be able to see through the disguise are\\n  called recipients. Other people are enemies, opponents, interlopers,\\n  eavesdroppers, or third parties.\\n\\n* What references can I start with to learn cryptology?\\n\\n  For an introduction to technical matter, the survey articles given\\n  in part 10 are the best place to begin as they are, in general,\\n  concise, authored by competent people, and well written. However,\\n  these articles are mostly concerned with cryptology as it has\\n  developed in the last 50 years or so, and are more abstract and\\n  mathematical than historical. The Codebreakers by Kahn [KAH67] is\\n  encyclopedic in its history and technical detail of cryptology up\\n  to the mid-60's.\\n\\n  Introductory cryptanalysis can be learned from Gaines [GAI44] or\\n  Sinkov [SIN66]. This is recommended especially for people who want\\n  to devise their own encryption algorithms since it is a common\\n  mistake to try to make a system before knowing how to break one.\\n\\n  The selection of an algorithm for the DES drew the attention of\\n  many public researchers to problems in cryptology. Consequently\\n  several textbooks and books to serve as texts have appeared. The\\n  book of Denning [DEN82] gives a good introduction to a broad range\\n  of security including encryption algorithms, database security,\\n  access control, and formal models of security. Similar comments\\n  apply to the books of Price & Davies [PRI84] and Pfleeger [PFL89].\\n\\n  The books of Konheim [KON81] and Meyer & Matyas [MEY82] are quite\\n  technical books. Both Konheim and Meyer were directly involved in\\n  the development of DES, and both books give a thorough analysis of\\n  DES. Konheim's book is quite mathematical, with detailed analyses\\n  of many classical cryptosystems. Meyer and Matyas concentrate on\\n  modern cryptographic methods, especially pertaining to key management\\n  and the integration of security facilities into computer systems and\\n  networks.\\n\\n  The books of Rueppel [RUE86] and Koblitz [KOB89] concentrate on\\n  the application of number theory and algebra to cryptography.\\n\\n* How does one go about cryptanalysis?\\n\\n  Classical cryptanalysis involves an interesting combination of\\n  analytical reasoning, application of mathematical tools, pattern\\n  finding, patience, determination, and luck. The best available\\n  textbooks on the subject are the Military Cryptanalytics series\\n  [FRIE1]. It is clear that proficiency in cryptanalysis is, for\\n  the most part, gained through the attempted solution of given\\n  systems. Such experience is considered so valuable that some of the\\n  cryptanalyses performed during WWII by the Allies are still\\n  classified.\\n\\n  Modern public-key cryptanalysis may consist of factoring an integer,\\n  or taking a discrete logarithm. These are not the traditional fare\\n  of the cryptanalyst. Computational number theorists are some of the\\n  most successful cryptanalysts against public key systems.\\n\\n* What is a brute-force search and what is its cryptographic relevance?\\n\\n  In a nutshell: If f(x) = y and you know y and can compute f, you can\\n  find x by trying every possible x. That's brute-force search.\\n\\n  Example: Say a cryptanalyst has found a plaintext and a corresponding\\n  ciphertext, but doesn't know the key. He can simply try encrypting the\\n  plaintext using each possible key, until the ciphertext matches---or\\n  decrypting the ciphertext to match the plaintext, whichever is faster.\\n  Every well-designed cryptosystem has such a large key space that this\\n  brute-force search is impractical.\\n    \\n  Advances in technology sometimes change what is considered\\n  practical. For example, DES, which has been in use for over 10 years\\n  now, has 2^56, or about 10^17, possible keys. A computation with\\n  this many operations was certainly unlikely for most users in the\\n  mid-70's. The situation is very different today given the dramatic\\n  decrease in cost per processor operation. Massively parallel\\n  machines threaten the security of DES against brute force search.\\n  Some scenarios are described by Garron and Outerbridge [GAR91].\\n\\n  One phase of a more sophisticated cryptanalysis may involve a\\n  brute-force search of some manageably small space of possibilities.\\n\\n* What are some properties satisfied by every strong cryptosystem?\\n\\n  The security of a strong system resides with the secrecy of the key\\n  rather than with an attempt to keep the algorithm itself secret.\\n\\n  A strong cryptosystem has a large keyspace, as mentioned above.  The\\n  unicity distance is a measure which gives the minimum amount of\\n  ciphertext that must be intercepted to uniquely identify the key and\\n  if for some key, the unicity distance is much longer than the amount\\n  of ciphertext you intend to encrypt under that key, the system is\\n  probably strong.\\n\\n  A strong cryptosystem will certainly produce ciphertext which appears\\n  random to all standard statistical tests (see, for example, [CAE90]).\\n    \\n  A strong cryptosystem will resist all known previous attacks. A\\n  system which has never been subjected to scrutiny is suspect.\\n\\n  If a system passes all the tests mentioned above, is it necessarily\\n  strong? Certainly not. Many weak cryptosystems looked good at first.\\n  However, sometimes it is possible to show that a cryptosystem is\\n  strong by mathematical proof. ``If Joe can break this system, then\\n  he can also solve the well-known difficult problem of factoring\\n  integers.'' See part 6.  Failing that, it's a crap shoot.\\n\\n* If a cryptosystem is theoretically unbreakable, then is it\\n  guaranteed analysis-proof in practice?\\n\\n  Cryptanalytic methods include what is known as ``practical\\n  cryptanalysis'': the enemy doesn't have to just stare at your\\n  ciphertext until he figures out the plaintext. For instance, he might\\n  assume ``cribs''---stretches of probable plaintext. If the crib is\\n  correct then he might be able to deduce the key and then decipher the\\n  rest of the message. Or he might exploit ``isologs''---the same\\n  plaintext enciphered in several cryptosystems or several keys. Thus\\n  he might obtain solutions even when cryptanalytic theory says he\\n  doesn't have a chance.\\n\\n  Sometimes, cryptosystems malfunction or are misused. The one-time pad,\\n  for example, loses all security if it is used more than once! Even\\n  chosen-plaintext attacks, where the enemy somehow feeds plaintext into\\n  the encryptor until he can deduce the key, have been employed. See\\n  [KAH67].\\n  \\n* Why are many people still using cryptosystems that are\\n  relatively easy to break?\",\n  \"\\nNow there's a good idea !

I know it has been\\nposted here several times, and while I do not have a copy of it, I am\\nsure that someone does and he (or she, of course) would be more than\\nhappy to repost it.\\n\\nRegardless of phrasing, groups like Hamas, and the Hezbollah, and\\neven the newly moderate and politically-correct PLO, have at the very\\nheart of their ideologies the need for the destrcution of Israel.\\n\\nIt just seems to me that Mr. Davidsson\\'s suggestion that Jews support\\npeople envolved in these organizations is not a particularly appealing\\none to many Jews.',\n  '\\n\\n   &gt;But is it any worse than the current unsecure system? It becomes much\\n   &gt;worse, of course, if the government then uses this \"Clinton Clipper\"\\n   &gt;to argue for restrictions on unapproved encryption. (This is the main\\n   &gt;concern of most of us, I think. The camel\\'s nose in the tent, etc.)\\n\\n   Excuse me?  This has *already* happened.  There\\'s a couple of humps in\\n   the tent already.  Ask the folks at Qualcomm what became of the\\n   non-trivial encryption scheme they proposed for use in their CDMA\\n   digitial cellular phone standard?  There *already* are restrictions in\\n   place.\\n\\nYou have it slightly wrong. They dumped the encryption system because\\nthey could not export it -- not because they could not produce it for\\nU.S. use. There are no legal restraints on citizen use of strong\\ncryptography -- yet.\\n--\\nPerry Metzger\\t\\tpmetzger@shearson.com',\n  'Miscellaneous comics for sale.

San Jose, Tampa Bay and \\nOttawa still will be allowed to exempt second-year pros.\\n        Each of the 24 teams will lose two players, with a maximum loss of \\none goaltender and a maximum loss of one defenseman. The one exception is \\nthat a team which loses a goaltender can then no longer lose a defenseman.\\n        At the end of the first phase of the draft, the two new franchises \\nwill have three goaltenders, eight defensemen and 13 forwards for a total \\nof 24 players. A second phase then will be conducted where San Jose, Tampa \\nBay and Ottawa will select two players each from the rosters of the two \\nnew teams.\\n        Ottawa, Tampa Bay and San Jose will be guaranteed priority \\ndrafting selection in the 1993 draft as long as they have the three worst \\nrecords. Anaheim and Miami will choose no lower than fourth and fifth. The \\nexpansion franchises will move up in the draft should either San Jose, \\nTampa Bay or Ottawa not finish in the bottom three positions.\\n        The two new teams will pick first and second in the 1994 Entry \\nDraft, regardless of their finish in 1993-94. Should either of the two new \\nteams not play next season they would have priority drafting position in \\n1994.\\n\\n        The owners announced the 1994 draft will be in Hartford and the \\n1995 draft in Winnipeg.

Answers to some frequently asked questions:\\n \\n Q: Why are the Montreal Canadiens called the Habs?\\n A: Most of the team during the 40-50\\'s was made up of people who lived in \\nand around Montreal. Hence they were called \"Les Habitants\" (natives of \\nMontreal).

It is\\nalso true that the results obtained by people today who still rely on \\nthose early methodologies needs to be re-examined in a more rigorous \\nfashion by those qualified to do so credibly.  \\n\\nBut to say that nobody who fails to do elaborate double-blind studies is\\ncapable of knowing their ass from a hole in the ground and to say that no\\nideas that come from outside the scientific establishment could possibly\\nbe worthy of serious investigation ... this truly marks one's attitude as\\ndoctrinaire, cultist.  This attitude is not compatible with a belief in\\nreason.  \\n\\n--\\nIn the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems \\nless like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.   \",\n  'With the continuin talk about the \"End of the Space Age\" and complaints \\nby government over the large cost, why not try something I read about \\nthat might just work.\\n\\nAnnounce that a reward of $1 billion would go to the first corporation \\nwho successfully keeps at least 1 person alive on the moon for a year. \\nThen you\\'d see some of the inexpensive but not popular technologies begin \\nto be developed.

You are probably thinking of Church of God in\\nChrist, the largest African-American Pentecostal denomination.\\n\\n\\t2)  I\\'m not sure what you mean by \"signifying believers\"  but it\\nshould be pointed out that the Assemblies of God does not now, nor has it\\never, held that speaking in tongues is the sign that one is a Christian. \\nThe doctrine that traditional Pentecostals (including the A/G) maintain is\\nthat speaking in tongues is the sign of a second experience after becoming\\na Christian in which one is \"Baptized in the Holy Spirit\"  That may be\\nwhat you were referring to, but I point this out because Pentecostals are\\nfrequently labeled as believing that you have to speak in tongues in order\\nto be a Christian.  Such a position is only held by some groups and not the\\nmajority of Pentecostals.   Many Pentecostals will quote the passage in\\nMark 16 about \"these signs following them that believe\" but they generally\\ndo not interpret this as meaning if you don\\'t pactice the signs you aren\\'t\\n\"saved\".\\n\\n\\t3)  I know it\\'s hard to summarize the beliefs of a movement that\\nhas such diversity, but I think you\\'ve made some pretty big\\ngeneralizations here.  Do \"Neo-Pentecostals\" only believe in tongues as a\\nsign and tongues as prayer but NOT tongues as revelatory with a message? \\nI\\'ve never heard of that before.  In fact I would have characterized them\\nas believing the same as Pentecostals except less likely to see tongues as\\na sign of Spirit Baptism.  Also, while neo-Pentecostals may not be\\ninclined to speak in tongues in the non-Pentecostal churches they attend,\\nthey do have their own meetings and, in many cases, a whole church will be\\ncharismatic.',\n  \"  Bingo.\\n Nothing evil at all.

Basically it changes things\\n   when told to by the server and then renders an image from the user's\\n   viewpoint. It also provides the server with information about the user's\\n   actions - which can then be communicated to other clients and therefore to\\n   other users.\\n\\n   The client is designed to be generic - in other words you don't need to\\n   develop a new client when you want to enter a new world. This means that\\n   resources can be spent on enhancing the client software rather than adapting\\n   it. The adaptations, as will be explained in a moment, occur in the servers.\\n\\n   This release of the client software supports the following functionality:\\n\\n    o Hierarchical Objects (with associated addressing)\\n\\n    o Multiple Light Sources and Types (Ambient, Point and Spot)\\n\\n    o User Interface Panels\\n\\n    o Colour Polygonal Rendering with Phong Shading (optional wireframe for\\n\\tfaster frame rates)\\n\\n    o Mouse and Keyboard Input\\n\\n   (Some people may be disappointed that this software doesn't support the\\n   PowerGlove as an input device - this is not because it can't, but because\\n   I don't have one! This will, however, be one of the first enhancements!)\\n\\n  Server(s):\\n   This is where customization can take place. The following basic support is\\n   provided in this release for potential world server developers:\\n\\n    o Transparent Client Management\\n\\n    o Client Message Handling\\n\\n   This may not sound like much, but it takes away the headache of\\naccepting and\\n   terminating clients and receiving messages from them - the\\napplication writer\\n   can work with the assumption that things are happening locally.\\n\\n   Things get more interesting in the object extension functionality. This is\\n   what is provided to allow you to animate your objects:\\n\\n    o Server Selectable Extension Installation:\\n        What this means is that you can decide which objects have extended\\n        functionality in your world. Basically you call the extension\\n        initialisers you want.\\n\\n    o Event Handler Registration:\\n        When you develop extensions for an object you basically write callback\\n        functions for the events that you want the object to respond to.\\n        (Current events supported: INIT, MOVE, CHANGE, COLLIDE & TERMINATE)\\n\\n    o Collision Detection Registration:\\n        If you want your object to respond to collision events just provide\\n        some basic information to the collision detection management software.\\n        Your callback will be activated when a collision occurs.\\n\\n    This software is kept separate from the worldServer applications because\\n    the application developer wants to build a library of extended objects\\n    from which to choose.\\n\\n    The following is all you need to make a World Server application:\\n\\n    o Provide an initWorld function:\\n        This is where you choose what object extensions will be supported, plus\\n        any initialization you want to do.\\n\\n    o Provide a positionObject function:\\n        This is where you determine where to place a new client.\\n\\n    o Provide an installWorldObjects function:\\n        This is where you load the world (.wld) file for a new client.\\n\\n    o Provide a getWorldType function:\\n        This is where you tell a new client what persona they should have.\\n\\n    o Provide an animateWorld function:\\n        This is where you can go wild! At a minimum you should let the objects\\n        move (by calling a move function) and let the server sleep for a bit\\n        (to avoid outrunning the clients).\\n\\n    That's all there is to it! And to prove it here are the line counts for the\\n    three world servers I've provided:\\n\\n        generic - 81 lines\\n        dactyl - 270 lines (more complicated collision detection due to the\\n                           stairs!

Here\\'s what the Russian mathematician Alexander Khinchin, a \\nspecialist in statistics, wrote about arithmetic: \"I willingly confess that \\nany time a fifth-grader asked me to help solve an arithmetic problem, it was\\na hard work for me, and sometimes I failed completely. Of course, like most of \\nmy friends, I could easily solve the problem by the natural algebraic route\\n--constructing equations or sets of equations. But we were supposed to avoid \\nusing algebraic analysis at all costs! . . . By the way, it\\'s a fact that is \\nwell known and oft repeated that, as a rule, neither high school graduates, \\nnor students at teaching colleges, nor teachers beginning their careers\\n(nor, I must add, scientific researchers) can solve arithmetic problems. It \\nseems the only people in the world who are able to solve them are fifth-grade \\nteachers.\"\\n\\nNow, I\\'m not insisting that a book of arithmetic problems be included in the \\nbookbag of anyone flying into space. But a sense of justice induces me to \\nrecommend one particular problem book, one that will satisfy the most \\nfastidious taste and supply food for thought sufficient not only for a \\nrelatively short flight to the Moon but for a extended space voyage--say, to\\nVenus and back.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\tOne for the \"road\"\\n\\n\\tThey both took out the books they brought for the road. Kingsley \\n\\tglanced at the Royal Astronomer\\'s book and saw a bright cover with \\n\\ta group of cutthroats shooting at each other with revolvers. \"God \\n\\tknows what this kind of stuff leads to,\" thought Kingsley.\\n\\n\\tThe Royal Astronomer looked at Kingsley\\'s book and saw the History \\n\\tof Herodotus. \"Good Lord, next he\\'ll be reading Thucydides,\" thought \\n\\tthe Royal Astronomer.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t--Fred Hoyle, The Black Cloud\\n\\nThe book I\\'m talking about isn\\'t very big, but its 24 problems constitute 24 \\nelegant miniatures from seventh-century Armenia. Naive and wise at the same\\ntime, rich in striking detail and the bright coloration of the period, these \\nproblems are reminiscent of the reliefs on the famous monument of Armenian \\narchitecture, the church on the island of Akhtamar in Lake Van (in what is \\nnow Turkey_. They are as inseparable from the image of Armenia as the elegant \\nletters of the Armenian alphabet, invented by Mesrop Mashtots, or the songs of \\nKomitas, or the paintings of Saryan.\\n\\nAn edition of these incredibly beautiful problems has long been a \\nbibliographic rarity. It was published under the title Problems and Solutions\\nof Vardapet [1] Anania of Shirak, Armenian Mathematician of the Seventh \\nCentury (translated and published by I. A. Orbeli, Petrograd, 1918).\\n\\nThe abundance of close observations and wide-ranging information about the way \\nof life and customs of that remote epoch when Anania of Shirak lived and \\nworked have actually rendered a disservice to his problem book. For many years \\nthe book was known only to researchers in the humanities--specialists in \\nArmenian history who jealously guarded their treasure and wouldn\\'t let just\\nanyone see it. Even now, after research by K. P. Patkanov, the learned monk \\nFather Kaloust, J.I. Orbeli, A. Abramyan, V. K. Chaloyan, and others has \\nbrought the works of Anania of Shirak to light in scholarly circles, the \\ngeneral reader remains ignorant of the very existence of this remarkable \\nproblem book.\\n\\n\\t\\tVardapet Anania of Shirak\\n\\n\\tOnce fell in love with the art of calculation, I thought that no \\n\\tphilosophical notion can be constructed without number, considering \\n\\tit the mother of all wisdom.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t--Anania of Shirak\\n\\nAmong ancient Armenian thinkers, Vardapet Anania of Shirak stands out because \\nof the breadth of his interests and the unique mathematical orientation of his \\nwork. Some of his works have been preserved. In addition to the Problems and\\nSolutions, the following tracts have found a special place in the estimation\\nof scholars: On Weights and Measures, Cosmography and Calendrical Theory, and\\nArmenian Geography of the Seventh Century A.D. (the authorship of the last\\nwork was long attributed to another outstanding thinker of ancient Armenia, \\nMovses of Khoren).\\n\\nIn his autobiography, Anania of Shirak has this to say about himself:\\n\\n\\tI, Anania of Shirak, having studied all the science of our\\n\\tArmenian land and having learned the Holy Scripture intimately, \\n\\tin the expression of the psalmist, \"every day I illuminated the \\n\\teyes of my mind.\" Feeling myself lacking in the art of calculation,\\n\\tI came to the conclusion that it is fruitless to study philosophy, \\n\\tthe mother of all sciences, without number. I could find in Armenia \\n\\tneither a man versed in philosophy nor books that explained the \\n\\tsciences. I therefore went to Greece and met in Theodosiople a man \\n\\tnamed Iliazar who was well versed in ecclesiastical works. He told me\\n\\tthat in Forth Armenia [2] there lived a famous mathematician,\\n\\tChristosatur. I went this person and spent six months with him. But \\n        soon I noticed that Christosatur was a master not of all science but \\n        only of certain fragmentary facts.\\n\\n\\tI then went to Constantinople, where I met acquaintances who told me: \\n\\t\"Why did you go so far, when much closer to us, in Trebizon, on the \\n\\tcoast of Pontus [3] lives the Byzantine vardapet Tyukhik. He is full \\n\\tof wisdom, is known to kings, and knows Armenian literature.\" I asked \\n\\tthem how they knew this. They answered: \"We saw ourselves that many \\n\\tpeople traveled long distances to become pupils of so learned a man. \\n\\tIndeed the archdeacon of the patriarchate of Constantinople,\\n\\tPhilagrus, traveled with us, bringing many young persons to become \\n\\tpupils of Tyukhik.\" When I heard this, I expressed my gratitude to \\n\\tGod, who had quenched the thirst of His slave.\\n\\n\\tI went to Tyukhik at the monastery of St. Eugene and explained why I \\n\\tHe sent you to learn and to transplant science in the domain of St. \\n\\tGregory; I am glad that all your country will learn from me. I myself \\n\\tlived in Armenia for many years as a youth. Ignorance reigned there.\" \\n\\tVardapet Tyukhik loved me as a son and shared all his thoughts with \\n\\tme. The Lord bestowed upon me His blessing: I completely assimilated \\n\\tthe science of number, and with such success that my fellow students\\n\\tat the king\\'s court began to envy me.\\n\\n\\tI spent eight years with Tyukhik and studied many books that had not \\n\\tbeen translated into our language. For the vardapet had an innumerable \\n\\tcollection of books: secret and explicit, ecclesiastical and pagan, \\n\\tbooks on art, history, and medicine, books of chronologies. Why \\n\\tenumerate them by title? In a word, there is no book that Tyukhik did \\n\\tnot have. And he had such a gift from the Holy Spirit for translating\\n\\tthat when he sat down to translate something from the Greek into \\n\\tArmenian, he did not struggle as other translators did, and the \\n\\ttranslation read as if the work were written in that language \\n\\toriginally.\\n\\n\\tTyukhik told me how he had achieved such vast erudition and how he had \\n\\tlearned the Armenian language. \"When I was young,\" he said, \"I lived \\n\\tin Trebizon, at the court of the military chief Ioannus Patricus, and \\n\\tfor a long time, up to the accession of Mauritius to the throne I \\n\\tserved as a military man in Armenia and learned your language and \\n\\tliterature. During one attack by Persian troops on the Greeks, I was \\n\\twounded and escaped to Antioch. I lost all my possessions. Praying to \\n\\tthe Lord to heal my wounds, I made a promise: \"If You prolong my life, \\n\\tI shall dedicate it not to accumulating perishable treasures but to \\n\\tcollecting treasures of knowledge.\" And the Lord heard my prayers. \\n\\tAfter I recovered I went to Jerusalem, and from there to Alexandria \\n\\tand Rome. Upon returning to Constantinople, I met a famous philosopher \\n\\tfrom Athens and studied with him for many years. After that I returned \\n\\tto my homeland and began to teach and instruct my people.\"\\n\\n\\tAfter some years that philosopher died. Not finding a replacement for \\n\\thim, the king and his courtiers sent for Tyukhik and invited him to \\n\\tassume the teacher\\'s position. Tyukhik, citing the promise he made to \\n\\tGod not to move far from the city, turned down the offer. But because\\n\\tof his wide leaning, people came streaming from all countries to study \\n\\twith him.\\n\\n\\tAnd I, the most insignificant of all Armenians, having learned from \\n\\thim this powerful science, desired by kings, brought it to our \\n\\tcountry, supported by no one, obligated only to my own industry, God\\'s \\n\\thelp, and the prayers of the Blessed Educator. And no one thanked me \\n\\tfor my efforts.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProblems and Solutions\\n\\n\\tA half and one sixth and one nine-ninth of all the books were printed\\n\\ton verge\\'; one fifth and one two-hundred-eighty-fifth--on rag paper; \\n\\tone forty-fifth and one eight-hundred-fifty-fifth--on vellum, and \\n\\tforty-five inscribed copies--on Dutch paper. And so, find how many \\n\\tcopies were printed in all.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t--Imitation of Anania of Shirak\\n\\nA Latin proverb says habent sua fata libelli (\"books have their own fate\").\\nThe fate of Problems and Solutions by Anania of Shirak is quite amazing. The\\nmanuscripts of Anania\\'s book were preserved only because, according to \\nArmenian historians, \"in ancient and medieval Armenia manuscripts were guarded \\nfrom invaders, like weapons, and cherished, like one\\'s own children.\" Biding\\ntheir time, the manuscripts lay in the Matenadaran, a renowned depository of \\nancient manuscripts (now the Mesrop Mashtots Institute of Ancient Manuscripts).\\nAnd its hour finally arrived. In 1896 the learned monk Father Kaloust used two \\nmanuscripts to publish the problem book, supplementing it with an introduction \\nand commentary. In 1918 the book was translated into Russian, edited, \\nannotated, and typeset by Iosef Orbeli, a prominent scholar (and later a \\nmember of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR).\\n\\nIn the translator\\'s words, the problems of Anania are \"amusing, full of life, \\nand simple.\" Orbeli goes on to say: \"The subjects of the problems are \\ngenerally taken from everyday life. The scene is predominantly his homeland \\nShirak and the surrounding countryside, and the dramatis personae, if they are \\nnamed, are the local princes--the Kamsarakans, including Nersekh, who was a \\ncontemporary of Anania.\" Like other ancient authors, Anania of Shirak used \\nonly \"aliquots\" -- that is, fractions with a numerator of 1. When it is\\nnecessary to write fractions with numerators other than 1, one has to \\nrepresent it as a sum of aliquots (see the epigraph above).\\n\\nLike any true work of art, the problems of Anania suffer terribly in the \\nretelling. You have to read the originals (albeit in translation) in their \\nfull glory. So let\\'s open Anania\\'s problem book--a gift from across the ages.\\n\\nProblems 1 and 8 relate to the Armenian uprising against the Persians in A.D. \\n572.\\n\\nProblem 1\\n\\nMy father told me the following story. During the famous wars between the \\nArmenians and the Persians, prince Zaurak Kamsarakan performed extraordinary \\nheroic deeds. Three times in a single month he attacked the Persian troops. \\nThe first time, he struck down half of the Persian army. The second time, \\npursuing the Persians, he slaughtered one fourth of the soldiers. The third \\ntime, he destroyed one eleventh of the Persian army. The Persians who were \\nstill alive, numbering two hundred eighty, fled to Nakhichevan. And so, from \\nthis remainder, find how many Persian soldiers there were before the massacre.\\n\\nProblem 8\\n\\nDuring the famous Armenian uprising against the Persians, when Zaurak\\nKamsarakan killed Suren, one of the Armenian azats[4] sent an envoy to the\\nPersian king to report the baleful news. The envoy covered fifty miles in a \\nday. Fifteen days later, when he learned of this, Zaurak Kamsarakan sent \\nriders in pursuit to bring the envoy back. The riders covered eighty miles in \\na day. And so, find how many days it took them to catch the envoy.\\n\\nProblem 18 mentions vessels made of varying amounts of metal. In the Russian \\ntranslation, they are all called \"dishes.\" But in the original Armenian, \\naccording to Orbeli\\'s note, the dishes in the first and second instances are \\ncalled mesur, and in the third instance scutel. Scutel is a common Armenian \\nword, but mesur had not been encountered in Armenian literature before \\nAnania\\'s Problems and Solutions.\\n\\nProblem 18\\n\\nThere was a tray in my house. I melted it down and made other vessels from the \\nmetal. From one third I made a mesur; from one fourth, another mesur; from\\none fifth, two goblets; from one sixth, two scutels; and from two hundred ten \\ndrams, I made a bowl. And now, find the weight of the tray.\\n\\nSeveral of the problems reflect the richness of the Caucasian fauna in \\nAnania\\'s time -- for instance, problem 7.\\n\\nProblem 7\\n\\nOnce I was in Marmet, the capital of the Kamsarakans. Strolling along the bank \\nof the river Akhuryan, I saw a school of fish and ordered that a net be cast. \\nWe caught a half and a quarter of the school, and all the fishes that slipped\\nout of the net ended up in a creel. When I looked in the creel, I found \\nforty-five fishes. And now, find how many fishes here were in all.\\n\\nThe temptation is great to present all 24 problems. But I\\'ll restrain myself\\nand offer you just one more.\\n\\nProblem 20 provides some interesting information about the wild animals that \\ninhabited Armenia at one time but now extinct for so long that there is no\\nmention of them even in zoological reference books. The wild donkey, according \\nto the generally accepted view, never roamed the Armenian lands. Yet Anania of \\nShirak offers evidence to the contrary .\\n\\nProblem 20\\n\\nThe hunting preserve of Nersekh Kamsarakan, ter[5] of Shirak and Asharunik, \\nwas at the base of the mountain called Artin. One night great herds of wild\\ndonkey entered the preserve. The hunters could not cope with the donkeys and, \\nrunning to the village of Talin, told Nersekh about them. When he arrived with\\nhis brothers and azats and entered the preserve, they began killing the wild \\nbeasts. Half of the animals were caught in traps, one fourth were killed by \\narrows. The young, which constituted one twelfth of all the animals, were \\ncaught alive, and three hundred sixty wild donkeys were killed by spears. And \\nso, find how many beasts there were at the start of this massacre.\\n\\n\\t\\t\"Set in type by me, Iosef Orbeli\"\\n\\n\\tHis biography could not be squeezed into the framework of a \\n\\tbibliography.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t-- K Uzbashyan, Academician\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tIosef Abgarovich Orbeli\\n\\nAnyone who is lucky enough to hold a copy (1/n of the small printing--n is the \\nsolution to the epigraph in the previous section) of the Russian translation \\nof Anania of Shirak\\'s Problems and Solutions, a thin book with yellowed pages,\\nhas probably noticed the variety of the fonts, the elegance of the borders, \\nand the high quality of the design, printing, and binding. Such great \\nattention to detail is characteristic of works that fulfill a requirement for \\na degree in bookmaking. And this problem book was indeed a kind of diploma \\nattesting to the professional maturity of the man who created it. An \\nadvertisement at the end of the book reads: \"This book was typeset in \\nDecember 1917 at the printing offices of the Russian Academy of Sciences by \\nme, Iosef Orbeli; the text was also proofread, laid out, and decorated with \\nborders by me.

',\n  \"\\nI was at an interesting seminar at work (UK's R.A.L. Space Science\\nDept.) on this subject, specifically on a small-scale Solar Sail\\nproposed as a student space project. The guy giving the talk was keen to\\ngenerate interest in the project. I'll typein the handout he gave out at\\nthe meeting. Here goes : \\n\\n\\t\\t\\tThe Microlight Solar Sail\\n\\t\\t\\t-------------------------\\n\\n1. Introduction\\nThe solar sail is a well-established concept. Harnessing the pressure of\\nsunlight, a spacecraft would have unlimited range. In principle, such a\\nvehicle could explore the whole Solar System with zero fuel consumption.\\n\\nHowever it is more difficult to design a practical solar sail than most\\npeople realize. The pressure of sunlight is only about one kilogram per\\nsquare kilometer. Deploying and controlling the large area of aluminized\\nfabric which would be necessary to transport a 'conventional' type\\nspacecraft is a daunting task. This is why, despite the potential of hte\\nidea, no such craft has actually been launched to date.\\n\\n2.Design\\nRecent advances in microelectronics make possible a different concept: a\\ntiny sail just a few metres in diameter which could be controlled purely\\nbe electronics, with no mechanical parts. Several attitude control\\nmethods are feasible: for example the pressure sunlight exerts on a\\npanel of solar cells varies according to whether power is being drawn.\\n\\nThe key components of the craft will be a minute CCD camera developed at\\nEdinburgh University which can act as both attitude sensor and data\\ngathering device; solar cells providing ~1 watt power for control and\\ncommunication; and a directional radio antenna etched onto the surface\\nof the sail itself. Launched as a piggyback payload, the total cost of\\nthe mission can be limited to a few tens of thousands of dollars.\\n\\n3.Missions\\nThe craft would be capable of some ambitious missions. For example:\\na) It could rendezvous with a nearby asteroid from the Apollo or Amor\\ngroups. Closeup pictures could be transmitted back to Earth at a low bit\\nrate.\\nb) It could be steered into a lunar polar orbit. Previously unobserved\\nareas around the lunar poles could be viewed. By angling the sail to\\nreflect sunlight downwards, polar craters whose bases never receive\\nsunlight could be imaged. Bright reflections would confirm that\\nvolatiles such as water ice have become trapped in these\\nlocations.[Immensely valuable information for setting up a manned lunar\\nbase, BTW]\\nc) It could be sent to rendezvous with a small asteroid or comet\\nnucleus. Impacting at low speed, a thin wire probe attached to the craft\\ncauses it to rebound while capturing a tiny sample is a sharp-edged\\ntube, like performing a biopsy. Returning to Earth, the sail acts as an\\nideal re-entry parachute: load per unit area 20 gm/m2 ensures that heat\\nis reradiated so efectively that the sail temperature cannot exceed ~300\\ndeg C. The material sample is recovered, enclosed in a small insulating\\ncontainer.\\n\\nContact: Colin Jack                              Tel. 0865-200447\\nOxford Mathematical Designs, 131 High Street, Oxford OX1 4DH, England\\n\\n--------------------------------\\n\\nThis guy would love to hear from anyone interested in this project or\\nseeking details or anything, and would be most happy to send you more\\ninformation.\\n\\n\\tAndy\\n\\n\\n\\n-- \",\n  'Library of Congress to Host Dead Sea Scroll Symposium April 21-22\\n To: National and Assignment desks, Daybook Editor\\n Contact: John Sullivan, 202-707-9216, or Lucy Suddreth, 202-707-9191\\n          both of the Library of Congress\\n\\n   WASHINGTON, April 19  -- A symposium on the Dead Sea \\nScrolls will be held at the Library of Congress on Wednesday,\\nApril 21, and Thursday, April 22.

Unlike the conventional large \\nVHF radars, in which output power of a large vacuum tube is distributed \\nto individual antenna elements, each of 475 solid state power amplifier \\nfeeds each antenna element. This system configuration enables very fast \\nbeam steering as well as various flexible operations by dividing the \\nantenna into independent subarrays, because phase shift and signal \\ndivision/combination are performed at a low signal level using \\nelectronic devices under control of a computer network. The antenna \\nbeam can be switched within 10 microsec to any direction within the \\nzenith angle of 30 deg. Since a precise phase alignment of each element \\nis crucial to realize the excellent performance of this system, careful \\ncalibration of the output phase of each power amplifier and antenna \\nelement was carried out. Among various aircraft which may be used for \\nthis purpose artificial satellites have an advantage of being able to \\nmake a long term monitoring with the same system. An antenna pattern \\nmonitoring system for the MU radar was developed using the scientific \\nsatellite OHZORA (EXOS-C).

What I have seen from the March Beta is\\nthat it doesn\\'t yet come with the stuff which exploits multi-user\\nfeatures.

My interpretation of this was that one user\\nper console but all the networking and RPC based stuff you want. \\n\\nI believe ftp and rlogin deamons for NT systems will come from third\\nparty. Somebody already has a Beta version of an unsecure ftpd on the\\nnet. There is no reason why one cannot write a posix based shell like\\ncsh on Unix for remote logins. \\n\\nIn general I liked NT when I checked it out. It slow compared to\\nWin3.1 (just like any other real OS). The beta version, although being\\nslow, botts up much faster than my SUN workstation. Windows subsystems\\nalso start up a lot faster than X windows. I believe Bill Gates was\\nright when he stated that NT was not for everybody. After playing\\naround with it for a while I was convinced. If I owned a busines using\\na \"business computer\" from IBM or some other established vendor, I\\nwould consider moving to NT platform because it would provide a much\\ncheaper solution (If you are running SQL servers etc.). It provides\\nthe robustness such an application requires. \\n\\nOn the other hand if you like your DOS games, more or less forget\\nabout NT. You can always boot to DOS  but in general that defeats\\nthe purpose of using NT. Most of NT\\'s features are visible in a\\nnetworked environment and in such an environment you can\\'t reboot your\\nmachine at will. For personal use, I would rather wait for the Win32\\nbased Windows release (whatever you name it) than jump to NT bandwagon.\\nI expect most applications will keep on using Win16 until Win32\\nbecomes widely available. \\n',\n  \"Hi there!\\n\\nWhat is your recommendation for a good hard-disk driver software for\\nnon-Apple drives?

The guidelines should be viewed as hints and suggestions.\\nX    Entries that violate the guidelines but remain within the rules are\\nX    allowed.  Even so, you are safer if you remain within the guidelines.\\nX\\nX    You should read the current IOCCC rules, prior to submitting entries.\\nX    The rules are typically sent out with these guidelines.\\nX\\nX\\nXWHAT IS NEW IN 1993:\\nX\\nX    The entry format is better (for us anyway).  The program mkentry.c\\nX    has been updated.  See ENTRY FORMAT.\\nX\\nX    We will reject entries that cannot be compiled using an ANSI C\\nX    compiler.  Certain old Obfuscation hacks that cause ANSI C compilers \\nX    fits are no longer permitted.  Some of the new issues deal with \\nX    non-integral array types, variable number of arguments, C preprocessor \\nX    directives and the exit() function.  See OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES.\\nX\\nX\\nXHINTS AND SUGGESTIONS:\\nX\\nX    You are encouraged to examine the winners of previous contests.  See\\nX    FOR MORE INFORMATION for details on how to get previous winners.\\nX\\nX    Keep in mind that rules change from year to year, so some winning entries\\nX    may not be valid entries this year.  What was unique and novel one year\\nX    might be \\'old\\' the next year.\\nX\\nX    An entry is usually examined in a number of ways.  We typically apply\\nX    a number of tests to an entry:\\nX\\nX\\t* look at the original source\\nX\\t* convert ANSI tri-graphs to ASCII\\nX\\t* C pre-process the source ignoring \\'#include\\' lines\\nX\\t* C pre-process the source ignoring \\'#define\\' and \\'#include\\' lines\\nX\\t* run it through a C beautifier\\nX\\t* examine the algorithm\\nX\\t* lint it\\nX\\t* compile it\\nX\\t* execute it\\nX\\nX    You should consider how your entry looks in each of the above tests.\\nX    You should ask yourself if your entry remains obscure after it has been\\nX    \\'cleaned up\\' by the C pre-processor and a C beautifier.\\nX\\nX    Your entry need not do well under all, or in most tests.  In certain\\nX    cases, a test is not important.  Entries that compete for the\\nX    \\'strangest/most creative source layout\\' need not do as well as\\nX    others in terms of their algorithm.  On the other hand, given\\nX    two such entries, we are more inclined to pick the entry that\\nX    does something interesting when you run it.\\nX\\nX    We try to avoid limiting creativity in our rules.  As such, we leave\\nX    the contest open for creative rule interpretation.  As in real life\\nX    programming, interpreting a requirements document or a customer request\\nX    is important.  For this reason, we often award \\'worst abuse of the\\nX    rules\\' to an entry that illustrates this point in an ironic way.\\nX\\nX    If you do plan to abuse the rules, we suggest that you let us know\\nX    in the remarks section.  Please note that an invitation to abuse\\nX    is not an invitation to break.  We are strict when it comes to the\\nX    3217 byte size limit.  Also, abusing the entry format tends to\\nX    annoy more than amuse.\\nX\\nX    We do realize that there are holes in the rules, and invite entries\\nX    to attempt to exploit them.  We will award \\'worst abuse of the rules\\'\\nX    and then plug the hole next year.  Even so, we will attempt to use\\nX    the smallest plug needed, if not smaller.  :-)\\nX\\nX    Check out your program and be sure that it works.  We sometimes make\\nX    the effort to debug an entry that has a slight problem, particularly\\nX    in or near the final round.  On the other hand, we have seen some\\nX    of the best entries fall down because they didn\\'t work.\\nX\\nX    We tend to look down on a prime number printer, that claims that\\nX    16 is a prime number.  If you do have a bug, you are better off\\nX    documenting it.  Noting \"this entry sometimes prints the 4th power\\nX    of a prime by mistake\" would save the above entry.  And sometimes,\\nX    a strange bug/feature can even help the entry!  Of course, a correctly\\nX    working entry is best.\\nX\\nX\\nXOUR LIKES AND DISLIKES:\\nX\\nX    Doing masses of #defines to obscure the source has become \\'old\\'.  We\\nX    tend to \\'see thru\\' masses of #defines due to our pre-processor tests\\nX    that we apply.  Simply abusing #defines or -Dfoo=bar won\\'t go as far\\nX    as a program that is more well rounded in confusion.\\nX\\nX    Many ANSI C compilers dislike the following code, and so do we:\\nX\\nX\\t#define d define\\nX\\t#d foo\\t\\t   &lt;-- don\\'t expect this to turn into #define foo\\nX\\nX\\tint i;\\nX\\tj;\\t\\t   &lt;-- don\\'t use such implicit type declaration\\nX\\tint k;\\nX\\nX    We suggest that you compile your entry with an ANSI C compiler.  If you \\nX    must use non-ANSI C, such as K&R C, you must avoid areas that result in \\nX    compile/link errors for ANSI C compilers.\\nX\\nX    Unfortunately, ANSI C requires array indexes to be of integral type.\\nX    Thus, the following classical obfuscation hacks are no longer allowed:\\nX\\nX\\tint i;\\nX\\tchar *c;\\nX\\ti[c];\\t\\t   &lt;--- use c[i] instead\\nX\\t(i+3)[\"string\"];   &lt;--- use \"string\"[i+3] instead\\nX\\nX    If your entry uses functions that have a variable number of\\nX    arguments, be careful. Systems implement va_list as a wide variety\\nX    of ways.  Because of this, a number of operations using va_list are\\nX    not portable and must not be used:\\nX\\nX\\t* assigning a non-va_list variable to/from a va_list variable\\nX\\t* casting a non-va_list variable into/from a va_list variable\\nX\\t* passing a va_list variable to a function expecting a non-va_list arg\\nX\\t* passing a non-va_list variable to a function expecting a va_list arg\\nX\\t* performing arithmetic on va_list variables\\nX\\t* using va_list as a structure or union\\nX\\nX    In particular, do not treat va_list variables as if they were a char **\\'s.\\nX\\nX    Avoid using &lt;varargs.h&gt;, use &lt;stdarg.h&gt; instead.\\nX\\nX    If you use C preprocessor directives (#define, #if, #ifdef, ...),\\nX    the leading \\'#\\' must be the first character on a line.  While some\\nX    C preprocessors allow whitespace the leading \\'#\\', many do not.\\nX\\nX    Because the exit() function returns void on some systems, entries\\nX    must not assume that it returns an int.\\nX\\nX    Small programs are best when they are short, obscure and concise.\\nX    While such programs are not as complex as other winners, they do\\nX    serve a useful purpose.  They are often the only program that people\\nX    attempt to completely understand.  For this reason, we look for\\nX    programs that are compact, and are instructional.\\nX\\nX    One line programs should be short one line programs, say around 80\\nX    bytes long.  Getting close to 160 bytes is a bit too long in our opinion.\\nX\\nX    We tend to dislike programs that:\\nX\\nX\\t* are very hardware specific\\nX\\t* are very OS or Un*x version specific\\nX\\t     (index/strchr differences are ok, but socket/streams specific\\nX\\t      code is likely not to be)\\nX\\t* dump core or have compiler warnings\\nX\\t     (it is ok only if you warn us in the \\'remark\\' header item)\\nX\\t* won\\'t compile under both BSD or SYS V Un*x\\nX\\t* abusing the build file to get around the size limit\\nX\\t* obfuscate by excessive use of ANSI tri-graphs\\nX\\t* are longer than they need to be\\nX\\t* are similar to previous winners\\nX\\t* are identical to previous losers  :-)\\nX\\nX    Unless you are cramped for space, or unless you are entering the\\nX    \\'best one liner\\' category, we suggest that you format your program\\nX    in a more creative way than simply forming excessively long lines.\\nX\\nX    The build file should not be used to try and get around the size\\nX    limit.  It is one thing to make use of a several -D\\'s to help out,\\nX    but it is quite another to use 200+ bytes of -D\\'s in order to\\nX    try and squeeze the source under the size limit.  You should feel\\nX    free to make use of the build file space, but you are better off\\nX    if you show some amount of restraint.\\nX\\nX    We allowed whitespace, and in certain cases ; { or } do not impact\\nX    your program size (up to a certain point), because we want to get\\nX    away from source that is simply a compact blob of characters.\\nX\\nX    Given two versions of the same program, one that is a compact blob\\nX    of code, and the other that is formatted more like a typical C\\nX    program, we tend to favor the second version.  Of course, a third\\nX    version of the same program that is formatted in an interesting\\nX    and/or obfuscated way, would definitely win over the first two!\\nX\\nX    We suggest that you avoid trying for the \\'smallest self-replicating\\'\\nX    program.  We are amazed at the many different sizes that claim\\nX    to be the smallest.  There is nothing wrong with self-replicating\\nX    programs.  In fact, a number of winners have been self-replicating.\\nX    You might want to avoid the claim of \\'smallest\\', lest we (or others)\\nX    know of a smaller one!\\nX\\nX    X client entries should be as portable as possible.  Entries that\\nX    adapt to a wide collection of environments will be favored.  Don\\'t\\nX    depend on a particular type of display.  For example, don\\'t depend\\nX    on color or a given size.  Don\\'t require backing store.\\nX\\nX    X client entries should avoid using X related libraries and\\nX    software that is not in wide spread use.  We ask that such X client\\nX    entries restrict themselves to only the low level Xlib and the\\nX    Athena widget set (libX11.a, libXaw.a, libXmu.a and libXt.a).\\nX    Don\\'t use M*tif, Xv*ew, or OpenL*ok toolkits, since not everyone\\nX    has them.  Avoid depending on a particular window manager.  Not\\nX    everyone has X11r5, and some people are stuck back in X11r4 (or\\nX    earlier), so try to target X11r5 without requiring X11r5.  Better\\nX    yet, try to make your entry run on all version 11 X Window Systems.\\nX\\nX    X client entries should not to depend on particular items on\\nX    .Xdefaults.  If you must do so, be sure to note the required lines\\nX    in the ---remark--- section.\\nX\\nX    We like programs that:\\nX\\nX\\t* are as concise and small as they need to be\\nX\\t* do something at least quasi-interesting\\nX\\t* pass lint without complaint (not a requirement, but it is nice)\\nX\\t* are portable\\nX\\t* are unique or novel in their obfuscation style\\nX\\t* MAKE USE OF A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF OBFUSCATION\\nX\\t* make us laugh and/or throw up  :-)\\nX\\nX    Some types of programs can\\'t excel in some areas.  Of course, your\\nX    program doesn\\'t have to excel in all areas, but doing well in several\\nX    areas really does help.\\nX\\nX    We freely admit that interesting, creative or humorous comments in\\nX    the ---remark--- section helps your chance of winning.  If you had to\\nX    read of many twisted entries, you too would enjoy a good laugh or two.\\nX    We think the readers of the contest winners do as well.\\nX\\nX    Be creative!\\nX\\nX\\nXENTRY FORMAT:\\nX\\nX    In order to help us process the many entries, we must request your\\nX    assistance by formatting your entries in a certain way.  This format,\\nX    in addition, allows us to quickly separate information about the\\nX    author from the program itself.  (see JUDGING PROCESS)\\nX\\nX    We have provided the program, mkentry, as an example of how to\\nX    format entries.  You should be aware of the following warning that\\nX    is found in mkentry.c:\\nX\\nX\\tThis program attempts to implement the IOCCC rules.  Every\\nX\\tattempt has been made to make sure that this program produces\\nX\\tan entry that conforms to the contest rules.  In all cases,\\nX\\twhere this program differs from the contest rules, the\\nX\\tcontest rules will be used.  Be sure to check with the\\nX\\tcontest rules before submitting an entry.\\nX\\nX    You are not required to use mkentry.  It is convenient, however,\\nX    as it attempts to uuencode the needed files, and attempt to check\\nX    the entry against the size rules.\\nX\\nX    If you have any suggestions, comments, fixes or complaints about\\nX    the mkentry.c program, please send Email to the judges.

If an entry wins, we will rename\\nX    its source and binary to avoid filename collision.  By tradition,\\nX    we use the name of the entry\\'s title, followed by an optional\\nX    digit in case of name conflicts.\\nX\\nX    If the above entry somehow won the \\'least likely to win\\' award,\\nX    we would use chonglab.c and chonglab.\\nX\\nX    If your entry depends on, or requires that your build, source\\nX    and/or binary files be a particular name, please say so in the\\nX    ---remark--- section.  If this case applies, it would be be helpful\\nX    if you did one of the following:\\nX\\nX\\t* Tell us how to change the filename(s) in your entry.\\nX\\nX\\t* Have the build file make copies of the files.  For example:\\nX\\nX\\t\\tcc prog.c -o special_name\\t\\tneed special binary\\nX\\nX\\t    or  rm -f special_src.c\\t\\t\\tneed special source\\nX\\t\\tcp prog.c special_src.c\\nX\\t\\tcc special_src.c -o special_name\\nX\\nX\\t    or  rm -f special_build\\t\\t\\tneed special build\\nX\\t\\ttail +4 build &gt; special_build\\nX\\t\\tsh &lt; special_build\\nX\\nX\\t* Assume that we will use the entry title.  Send us a version of \\nX\\t  your build/program files that uses the name convention.  You \\nX\\t  should uuencode these files in ---data--- sections.\\nX\\nX    If your entry needs to modify its source, info or binary files,\\nX    please say so in the ---remark--- section.  You should try to avoid\\nX    touching your original build, source and binary files.  You should\\nX    arrange to make copies of the files you intend to modify.  This\\nX    will allow people to re-generate your entry from scratch.\\nX\\nX    Remember that your entry may be built without a build file.  We\\nX    typically incorporate the build lines into a Makefile.  If the\\nX    build file must exist, say so in the ---remark--- section.\\nX\\nX    If your entry needs special info files, you should uuencode them\\nX    into ---info--- sections.  In the case of multiple info files,\\nX    use multiple ---info--- sections.  If no info files are needed,\\nX    then skip the ---info--- section.\\nX\\nX    Info files are intended to be input, or detailed information that\\nX    does not fit well into the ---remark--- section.  For example, an\\nX    entry that implements a compiler might want to provide some sample\\nX    programs for the user to compile.  An entry might want to include a\\nX    lengthy design document, that might not be appropriate for a\\nX    \\'hints\\' file.\\nX\\nX    Info files should be used only to supplement your entry.  For\\nX    example, info files may provide sample input or detailed\\nX    information about your entry.  Because they are supplemental,\\nX    the entry should not require them exist.\\nX\\nX    In some cases, your info files might be renamed to avoid name\\nX    conflicts.  If info files should not be renamed for some reason,\\nX    say so in the ---remark--- section.\\nX\\nX    Info files must uudecode into the current directory.  If they\\nX    absolutely must be renamed, or moved into a sub-directory, say\\nX    so in the ---remark--- section.\\nX\\nX    When submitting multiple entries, be sure that each entry has\\nX    a unique entry number from 0 to 7.  Your first entry should\\nX    have entry number 0.\\nX\\nX    With the exception of the header, all text outside of the entry\\nX    format may be ignored.  That is, don\\'t place text outside of the\\nX    entry and expect the judges to see it.  (Our decoding tools aren\\'t\\nX    AI progs!) If you need tell the the something, put it in the \\nX    ---remark--- section, or send a Email to the judges at:\\nX\\nX\\t...!{apple,pyramid,sun,uunet}!hoptoad!judges\\t(not the address for\\nX\\tjudges@toad.com\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t submitting entries)\\nX    \\nX    The date should be given with respect to UTC.  (Some systems refer \\nX    to this as GMT or GMT0)  The format of the date should be that as \\nX    returned by asctime() in the C locale.  An example of such a string is:\\nX\\nX\\tThr Apr 01 00:47:00 1993\\nX\\nX    This format is similar to the output of the date(1) command.  The\\nX    string does not include the timezone name before the year.

To do so, set\\nX    the \\'fix\\' line in the ---entry--- section to \\'y\\' instead of \\'n\\'.\\nX    Be sure that the resubmittion uses the same title and entry number\\nX    as well, as these are used to determine which entry is to be\\nX    replaced.\\nX\\nX\\nXJUDGING PROCESS:\\nX\\nX    Entries are judged by Larry Bassel and Landon Curt Noll.\\nX\\nX    Entries are unpacked into individual directories.  The Email message\\nX    is unpacked into individual files, each containing:\\nX\\nX\\t---entry--- section\\nX\\tall ---author--- sections\\nX\\tall ---info--- sections\\nX\\t---build--- section\\nX\\t---program--- section\\nX\\tany other text, including the Email message headers\\nX\\nX    Prior to judging, the \\'any other text\\' file is scanned to be sure\\nX    it does not contain useful information (or in case the entry was\\nX    malformed and did not unpack correctly).  Information from the\\nX    ---author--- sections are not read until the judging process is\\nX    complete, and then only from entries that have won an award.\\nX\\nX    The above process helps keep us biased for/against any one particular\\nX    individual.  We are usually kept in the dark as much as you are\\nX    until the final awards are given.  We like the surprise of finding\\nX    out in the end, who won and where they were from.\\nX\\nX    We attempt to keep all entries anonymous, unless they win an award.\\nX    Because the main \\'prize\\' of winning is being announced, we make all\\nX    attempts to send non-winners into oblivion.  We remove all non-winning\\nX    files, and shred all related paper.  By tradition, we do not even\\nX    reveal the number of entries that we received.  (for the curious,\\nX    we do indicate the volume of paper consumed when presenting the IOCCC\\nX    winners at talks)\\nX\\nX    After the Usenix announcement, we attempt to send Email to the\\nX    authors of the winning entries.  One reason we do this is to give\\nX    the authors a chance to comment on the way we have presented their\\nX    entry.  They are given the chance to correct mistakes, typos.  We\\nX    often accept their suggestions/comments about our remarks as well.\\nX    This is done prior to posting the winners to the wide world.\\nX\\nX    Judging consists of a number of elimination rounds.  During a round,\\nX    the collection of entries are divided into two roughly equal piles;\\nX    the pile that advances on to the next round, and the pile that does\\nX    not.  We also re-examine the entries that were eliminated in the\\nX    previous round.  Thus, an entry gets at least two readings.\\nX\\nX    A reading consists of a number of actions:\\nX\\nX\\t* reading the ---entry--- section\\nX\\t* reading the uudecoded ---build--- section\\nX\\t* reading the uudecoded ---program--- section\\nX\\t* reading the uudecoded ---info--- section(s), if any\\nX\\t* passing the source thru the C pre-processor\\nX\\t    shipping over any #include files\\nX\\t* performing a number of C beautify/cleanup edits on the source\\nX\\t* passing the beautified source thru the C pre-processor\\nX\\t    shipping over any #include files\\nX\\nX    In later rounds, other actions are performed:\\nX\\nX\\t* linting the source\\nX\\t* compiling/building the source\\nX\\t* running the program\\nX\\t* performing misc tests on the source and binary\\nX\\nX    Until we reduce the stack of entries down to about 25 entries, entries\\nX    are judged on an individual basis.  An entry is set aside because it\\nX    does not, in our opinion, meet the standard established by the round.\\nX    When the number of entries thins to about 25 entries, we begin to form\\nX    award categories.  Entries begin to compete with each other for awards.\\nX    An entry often will compete in several categories.\\nX\\nX    The actual award category list will vary depending on the types of entries\\nX    we receive.  A typical category list might be:\\nX\\nX\\t* best small one line program\\nX\\t* best small program\\nX\\t* strangest/most creative source layout\\nX\\t* most useful obfuscated program\\nX\\t* best game that is obfuscated\\nX\\t* most creatively obfuscated program\\nX\\t* most deceptive C code\\nX\\t* best X client (see OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES)\\nX\\t* best abuse of ANSI C\\nX\\t* worst abuse of the rules\\nX\\t* &lt;anything else so strange that it deserves an award&gt;\\nX\\nX    We do not limit ourselves to this list.  For example, a few entries are so\\nX    good/bad that they are declared winners at the start of the final round.\\nX    We will invent awards categories for them, if necessary.\\nX\\nX    In the final round process, we perform the difficult tasks of\\nX    reducing the remaining entries (typically about 25) down to 8 or 10\\nX    winners.  Often we are confident that the entries that make it into\\nX    the final round are definitely better than the ones that do not\\nX    make it.  The selection of the winners out of the final round, is\\nX    less clear cut.\\nX\\nX    Sometimes a final round entry good enough to win, but is beat out\\nX    by a similar, but slightly better entry.  For this reason, it is\\nX    sometimes worthwhile to re-enter an improved version of an entry \\nX    that failed to win in a previous year.  This assumes, of course, \\nX    that the entry is worth improving in the first place!\\nX\\nX    More often that not, we select a small entry (usually one line), a\\nX    strange/creative layout entry, and an entry that abuses the contest\\nX    rules in some way.\\nX\\nX    In the end, we traditionally pick one entry as \\'best\\'.  Sometimes such\\nX    an entry simply far exceeds any of the other entry.  More often, the\\nX    \\'best\\' is picked because it does well in a number of categories.\\nX\\nX\\nXANNOUNCEMENT OF WINNERS:\\nX\\nX    The first announcement, occurs at a Summer Usenix conference.  By tradition,\\nX    this is done during the latter part of the UUNET/IOCCC BOF, just prior to\\nX    the Berkeley BSD, and BSDI BOF.\\nX\\nX    Winning entries will be posted in late June to the following groups:\\nX\\nX\\t    comp.lang.c\\t\\t  comp.unix.wizards\\talt.sources\\nX\\nX    In addition, pointers to these postings are posted to the following\\nX\\nX\\t    comp.sources.d\\t  alt.sources.d\\t\\tmisc.misc\\nX\\t    comp.sources.misc\\t  comp.windows.x\\nX\\nX    Winning entries will be deposited into the uunet archives.

Go shoot a revolver and a semi-auto like the\\nColt .45. Does one fires faster than the other? Nope. Aside from which\\nfaster rate of fire is usually not desirable. Sure it makes the other\\nguys duck for cover, but just *YOU* trying hitting anything with a Thompson\\nin hose-mode. This is why the military is limiting it\\'s M-16 now to\\n3-round burst-fire. Simple semi-auto would be better, but the troops\\nlike to be able to rock and roll even if it is wasteful of ammo (something\\noften in short supply when the enemy is plentiful).\\n\\nA revolver is equally capable as a semi-auto in the same caliber.\\n\\n- A revolver also has the advantage that if it misfires you just pull\\n  the trigger again.\\n- A double-action revolver (almost all of them) can be hand-cocked first,\\n  but will fire merely by pulling the trigger.\\n- A misfire in a revolver merely means you must pull the trigger again\\n  to rotate to the next round.\\n- A revolver can be carried with the 6th chamber empty and under the\\n  hammer for maximum safety, but still can be drawn and fired with an\\n  easy motion, even one handed.\\n- Speedloaders for a revolver allow reloads almost as fast as magazines\\n  on semi-autos. Can be faster depending on users.\\n\\n- A misfire in a semi-auto will require you to clear a jammed shell\\n  first, time spent which can be fatal. And a vital second or so is often\\n  lost as you realize \"hey, it\\'s jammed!\" before starting to do anything\\n  about clearing it.\\n- Most semi-autos must have the slide worked to chamber the first round\\n  and cock the hammer. Some police carry their semi-autos with the \\n  chamber loaded and hammer cocked, but a safety engaged. I do not consider\\n  this safe however. You must trade-off safety to get the same speed\\n  of employment as a revolver.\\n- There are some double-action semi-autos out there, but the complexity of\\n  operation of many of them requires more training.\\n\\nSome police departments switched to Glocks, and then started quietly\\nswitching many officers back to the old revolvers. Too many were having\\naccidents, partly due to the poor training they received. Not that Glocks\\nrequire rocket scientists, but some cops are baffled by something as complex\\nas the timer on a VCR.\\n\\nAnyone who goes anyone saying that the criminals obviously outgun\\nthe police don\\'t know nothing about firearms. Turn off COPS and Hunter\\nand pay attention. I do not seek here to say \"semi-autos are junk\"\\nmerely that assuming they are better for all jobs is stupid. A cop\\nwith a revolver on his hip and a shotgun in the rack is more than\\nequipped for anything short of a riot.\\n\\nGun control is hitting what you aim at. If you whip out a \\nwonder-nine and fire real fast you may find you don\\'t hit anything.\\nGood controlled fire from a revolver is more likely to get you a hit.\\nI own a 9mm Beretta myself but consider it inferior as a carry weapon\\nto something like the Ruger Security Six revolver. If I haven\\'t hit\\nwhat I\\'m aiming at in the first 5 shots, something is quite seriously\\nwrong somewheres. While I might like having the backup capacity of those\\nextra shots in certain cases, overwhelmingly the # of shots fired in\\ncriminal encounters is less than 5.\\n\\nWhat do crooks overwhelmingly use in crime? Why the same nice simple\\n.38 revolvers that the police often use. Well actually some police \\nprefer the much heftier .357 Magnum, but anyway.....\\n\\nObPlea: Don\\'t flame me, I prefer semi-autos for most things.

Hrudey made 21 saves in Sundays\\n6-3 opening victory.\\n\\nBut Stauber clearly is upset with his sudden status as the No. 3 man behind Rick\\nKnickle.  Stauber had a 4-1-2 record and 2.98 goals-against average down the\\nstretch in the regular season and nearly wrestled the No. 1 job from Hrudey.\\n\\nKnickle?  He won 2 of 3 decisions but had a bloated 5.26 average, twice was \\nyanked from games (once for stomach cramps) and hasn\\'t played since March 29.\\n\\nYet, when the series resumes Wednesday, Knickle will serve as Hrudey\\'s backup\\nagain and Stauber will have to satisfy his playoff hunger by munching on Olympic\\nSaddledome popcorn.\\n\\n\"If I\\'m supposedly close to being the starter or could have been the starter...I\\ndropped too. 3.  What happened to No. 2?\"  Stauber wondered.  \"Not that I\\'d be\\nhappy with No. 2, but I feel I should at least be a part of this team in the\\nplayoffs.\"\\n\\nPerhaps Stauber eventually will get his chance, but Melrose apparently is not\\nconvinced the 25-year old is capable of handling playoff pressure.\\n\\nWhile insisting he is the Kings\\' \"goalie of the future,\" Melrose said Stauber\\nflubbed all four of the big games he was asked to win this season.  They were,\\naccording to Melrose: a 7-2 loss to San Jose on Dec. 26; An 8-3 loss to the New\\nYork Rangers on Jan. 23; a 6-6 tie with Detroit on Feb. 11; an 8-6 loss to \\nVancouver on Thursday.\\n\\n\"Four times this season Robb could have emerged as the elite goalie, he could\\nhave taken it away from Kelly Hrudey, and he didn\\'t do it,\" Melrose said.  \"An\\nelite goaltender has to carry the ball when you give it to him.  The mark of a\\ngreat goalie is that he isn\\'t satisfied to be a backup.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m not blaming Robb for the losses, but if you\\'re going to be No. 1, you\\'ve\\ngot to be able to walk your talk.  You\\'ve got to be able to play when everything\\nis on the line.  Robb Stauber has a great deal of ability, but maybe I expect\\nmore from him than he does.\"\\n\\nOuch.  That remark stung Stauber.  He began the season 9-0-1, struggled when the\\nteam hit a mid-season slump, didn\\'t play for a month after Knickle was signed\\noff the San Diego Gulls roster, then came on at the end.\\n\\n\"I expect more from myself than anybody, including Barry Melrose,\" said Stauber,\\na three-year star at the University of Minnesota who left school in 1989, only \\nto have his development hampered by a string of serious injuries.\\n\\n\"What I\\'ve been through the last four years - two knee operations, a herniated\\ndisk in my back, shoulder surgery - what more can I go through?  I obviously do\\nexpect a lot from myself, otherwise I wouldn\\'t be here.\"\\n\\n\"Anybody who would disagree with that doesn\\'t know me.  I\\'m not saying Barry \\ndoesn\\'t know me, but don\\'t say I\\'ve been without expectations.  If anything, I\\'m\\na perfectionist.\"\\n\\nStauber acknowledged he played poorly in the four games Melrose mentioned. \"But \\neven though I didn\\'t play well, I get knocked down from maybe on to three? It\\'s \\na bit of a jump,\" he said.  \"You\\'re almost No. 1, or if you play a good game \\nyou\\'re No. 1 and if you don\\'t you\\'re No. 3?  Why does Jack Nicklaus shoot a 67 \\nand then a 75?  Can you explain that?  That\\'s what barry wanted me to explain \\nto him, why I didn\\'t come through when he counted on me.  I don\\'t know. What I \\ndo know is, it\\'s a sport.  I\\'ll be there.\"\\n\\nMelrose\\'s \"goalie of the future\" statement doesn\\'t mean much to Stauber. \"Before\\nyou know it, I\\'ll be 30 and there will be no future,\" he said.\\n\\n------\\n\\n*Game 1 of the Kings @ Flames playoff series drew a 4.2 Nielsen rating on ABC \\nChannel 7 here in LA.

I also conclude that James 2, when \\nread in context, is teaching bullet (2) above.

Also according \\nto James 2, the abscence of such works is evidence for a \"dead\" or \\n\"useless\" faith which fails to save.\\n\\nJames 2 is not a problem for the doctrine of salvation by faith if it\\nis teaching (2).

Spence moved for a mistrial but was denied.\\n\\nThe day was marked by a caustic cross-examination of Deputy\\nMarshal Larry Cooper by defense attorney Gerry Spence.  Although\\nSpence has not explicitly stated so, one angle of his stategy\\nmust involve destroying the credibility of agent Cooper.  Cooper is\\nthe government\\'s only eyewitness to the death of agent Degan.\\nSpence attacked Cooper\\'s credibility by pointing out discrepancies\\nbetween Cooper\\'s statements last September and those made in court.\\nCooper conceded that, \"You have all these things compressed into\\na few seconds...It\\'s difficult to remember what went on first.\"\\n\\nCooper acknowledged that he carried a \"9mm Colt Commando submachine\\ngun with a silenced barrel.\" [I thought a Colt Commando was a revolver!]\\nCooper continued by stating that the federal agents had no specific\\nplans to use the weapon when they started to kill Weaver\\'s dog.\\n\\nWhen Spence asked how seven cartridges could be fired by Degan\\'s\\nM-16 rifle when Degan was apparently dead, Cooper could not say for\\nsure that Degan did not return fire before going down.\\n\\nSpence continued by asking with how many agents (and to what extent)\\nhad Cooper discussed last August\\'s events, Cooper responded, \"If\\nyou\\'re implying that we got our story together, you\\'re wrong,\\ncounselor.\"  Spence continued to advance the defense\\'s version of\\nthe events: Namely, that a marshal had started the shooting by\\nkilling the Weaver\\'s dog.  Cooper disagreed.\\n\\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Ronald Howen repeatedly objected to Spence\\'s\\nvirulent cross-examination of agent Cooper, arguing that the questions\\nwere repetitive and Spence was wasting time.  Howen also complained \\nthat Spence was improperly using a cross-examination to advance the\\ndefense\\'s version of the events.  U.S. District Judge Edward Lodge\\nsustained many of the objections; however, both lawyers persisted\\nuntil Judge Lodge had the jury leave the room and proceded to\\nadmonish both attorneys.  \"I\\'m not going to play games with either\\ncounsel.  This has been a personality problem from day 1, so start\\nacting like professionals.\"\\n\\nSpence told the judge that, \"When all the evidence is in, we\\'ll see\\nthat ... his [agent Larry Cooper] testimony is not credible, that\\nhe was panicked and cannot remember the sequence of events.\" \\nSpence continued, \"We\\'re going to find...that there is a very unlikely\\nsimilarity - almost as if it had come out of a cookie cutter - between\\nthe testimony of Mr. Cooper and the other witnesses.\"\\n\\nSpence then moved for a mistrial on the grounds that Howen\\'s repeated\\nobjections would prevent a fair trial, \"We can\\'t have a fair trial if the\\njury believes I\\'m some sort of charlatan, if the jury believes I\\'m\\nbending the rules or engaging in some delaying tactic or that I\\'m\\nviolating court orders.\"\\n\\nJudge Lodge called the notion that his repeated sustainings of Howen\\'s\\nobjections had somehow prejudiced the jury was \"preposterous\" and\\ndenied the motion for a mistrial.  Lodge did tell Howen to restrict\\nhis comments when objecting.\\n\\nThe trial resumed with the prosecution calling FBI Special Agent Greg\\nRampton.  The prosecution\\'s purpose was simply to introduce five\\nweapons found in the cabin as evidence: However, the defense seized\\non the opportunity to further address Cooper\\'s credibility.\\n\\nDefense attorney Ellison Matthews (Harris\\' other attorney) questioned\\nRampton about the dog.  Rampton stated that there were no specific\\nplans to kill the Weaver\\'s dog without being detected.  Matthews then\\nhad Rampton read  a Septtember 15, 1992 transcript in which Rampton\\nhad said that Cooper had said that the purpose of the silenced weapon\\nwas to kill the dog without being detected, if the dog chased them.\\nRampton then acknowledged that he believed that Cooper had said that,\\nbut he could not remember when.  He then stated that, \"I did not conduct\\nthe primary interview with Deputy Cooper, but I have had conversations\\nwith him since the interview was conducted.\"',\n  \"I need a off-the-shelf method of transmitting small amounts of data up to\\n300 feet.

At minimum a good helmet\\nand a pair of leather gloves are a must.  A good sturdy \\npiece of footgear is also very helpful, though leather hiking\\nboots, a pair of old army boots, or something similar works fine\\nfor this purpose as long as you make sure the laces stay \\ntied.

(Yes, my opinion.)\\n \\n\\nSure.  The Bible preaches absolute truths.  However, exactly what those\\ntruths are is sometimes a matter of confusion.  As I said, the Bible does\\npreach absolute truths.  Sometimes those fundamental principles are crystal\\nclear (at least to evangelicals).  Sometimes they are not so clear to\\neveryone (e.g. should baptism be by full immersion or not, etc).  That is\\nlargely because sometimes, it is not explicitly spelled out whether the writers\\nare speaking to a particular culture or to Christianity as a whole.  This is \\nwhere scholarship and the study of Biblical contexts comes in.  \\n \\n\\nGod revealed his Truths to the world, through His Word.  It is utterly \\nunavoidable, however, that some people whill come up with alternate \\ninterpretations.  Practically anything can be misinterpreted, especially\\nwhen it comes to matters of right and wrong.

If Muslims -- who perhaps\\nhave not realized that Islam teaches this -- perform such actions, it is\\n_not_ _because_ of the teachings of Islam, but rather _in spite of_ and\\n_in contradiction to_ the  teachings of Islam.  This is an important \\ndistinction.\\n\\nI should clarify what Muslims usually mean when they say \"Muslim\".  In\\ngeneral, anyone who calls themselves a \"Muslim\" and does not do or \\noutwardly profess\\nsomething in clear contradiction with the essential teachings of Islam\\nis considered to be a Muslim.  Thus, one who might do things contrary to\\nIslam (through ignorance, for example) does not suddenly _not_ become a\\nMuslim.  If one knowingly transgresses Islamic teachings and essential\\nprinciples, though, then one does leave Islam.\\n\\nThe term \"Muslim\" is to be contrasted with \"Mu\\'min\", which means \"true\\nbeliever\".  However, whether a Muslim is in reality a Mu\\'min is\\nsomething known only by God (and perhaps that person himself).  So you\\nwill not find the term Mu\\'min used very much by Muslims in alt.atheism,\\nbecause it is not known to anybody (except myself and God), whether I,\\nfor example, am a \"true believer\" or not.  For example, I could just be\\nputting on a show here, and in reality believe something opposite to\\nwhat I write here, without anyone knowing.  Thus, when we say \"Muslims\"\\nwe mean all those who outwardly profess to follow Islam, whether in\\npractice they might, in ignorance, transgress Islamic teachings.

Good and\\nevil are the most thought provoking polarities that come to mind.\\n\\nThe Bible provides us with many examples of the fragmentation of\\nbeing. The warring opposites within us are a product of man\\'s\\nrebellion against God, which is described so vividly in the pages of\\nthe Scriptures.\\n\\nMan was created with the order to become a god. Those were the words\\nof St.  Basil in the fourth century. What he was trying to say was\\nthat God created man to be a partaker of the divine nature. In the\\nEastern Orthodox Church, this is called \"theosis,\" or \"deification.\"\\n\\nOne can also say that man was created to be whole, i.e. spirit, soul,\\nand body operating in unison. The story of Adam and Eve is a picture\\nof the archetypal humans before obtaining moral consciousness. Theirs\\nwas a harmonious relationship with each other, the world, and the\\nCreator. That innocent harmony was shattered when they disobeyed God,\\ntheir natural wholeness falling apart into two seemingly\\nirreconcilable halves. Immediately, guilt and fear was manifested in\\ntheir lives. They become bound to hardship, toil, and suffering.  This\\nis symbolized in their exile from the paradisiac state.\\n\\nThe beast in the jungle does not possess moral consciousness. If it\\nwere to receive this self-awareness, the knowledge of good and evil,\\nits paradisiac state would also be destroyed.\\n\\nWas it the intention of the Creator to leave man in this state of\\ninnocence all the days of his existence on earth? Or was the gaining\\nof self-awareness carefully staged by God, who did not desire that His\\nmasterpiece, mankind, be a blissful idiot?\\n\\nGod must have known that, for mankind to achieve any kind of moral\\nvalue, he must pass through a confrontation with the opposites. There\\nis no other way to achieve union with God.\\n\\nJesus Christ is the answer to the problem of the warring polarities.\\nHe was the perfectly integrated individual, reconciling the opposites,\\nand making it possible for us to be integrated, i.e. to become God,\\nnot in His essence, but in His energies.\\n\\nThe opposites is THE Christian problem.

He\\'s kept a record of the results, and for over \\n2000 patients found that over 90% of his patients get significant relief\\nof allergic/sinus symptoms.  Of course, this is only the beginning for his\\nprogram.\\n\\nIn my case, as I reported a few weeks ago, I was developing the classic\\nsymptoms outlined in \\'The Yeast Connection\\' (I agree it is a poorly \\nwritten book):  e.g., extreme sensitivity to plastics, vapors, etc. which\\nI never had before (started in November).  Within one week of full dosage\\nof Sporanox, the sensitivity to chemicals has fully disappeared - I can\\nnow sit on my couch at home without dying after two minutes.  I\\'m also\\n*greatly* improved in other areas as well.\\n\\nOf course, I have allergy symptoms, etc.  I am especially allergic to\\nmolds, yeasts, etc.  It doesn\\'t take a rocket scientist to figure out that\\nif one has excessive colonization of yeast in the body, and you have a\\nnatural allergy to yeasts, that a threshold would be reached where you\\nwould have perceptible symptoms.  Also, yeast do produce toxins of various\\nsorts, and again, you don\\'t have to be a rocket scientist to realize that\\nsuch toxins can cause problems in some people.  In my case it was sinus\\nsince that\\'s the center of my allergic response.  Of course, the $60,000\\nquestion is whether a person who is immune compromised (as tests showed I was\\nfrom over 5 years of antibiotics, nutritionally-deficiencies because of the\\nstress of infections and allergies, etc.), can develop excessive yeast\\ncolonization somewhere in the body.  It is a tough question to answer since\\ntesting for excessive yeast colonization is not easy.  One almost has to\\ntake an empirical approach to diagnosis.  Fortunately, Sporanox is relatively\\nsafe unlike past anti-fungals (still have to be careful, however) so there\\'s\\nno reason any longer to withhold Sporanox treatment for empirical reasons.\\n\\nBTW, some would say to try Nystatin.  Unfortunately, most yeast grows hyphae\\ntoo deep into tissue for Nystatin to have any permanent affect.  You\\'ll find\\na lot of people who are on Nystatin all the time.\\n\\nIn summary, I appreciate all of the attempts by those who desire to keep\\nmedicine on the right road.

Gibbons, Director, Office of Science and Technology\\nPolicy, outlined to the members-designate of the Advisory Committee on the\\nRedesign of the Space Station on April 3, three budget options as guidance\\nto the committee in their deliberations on the redesign of the space\\nstation.\\n\\n        A low option of $5 billion, a mid-range option of $7 billion and a\\nhigh option of $9 billion will be considered by the committee.  Each\\noption would cover the total expenditures for space station from fiscal\\nyear 1994 through 1998 and would include funds for development,\\noperations, utilization, Shuttle integration, facilities, research\\noperations support, transition cost and also must include adequate program\\nreserves to insure program implementation within the available funds.\\n\\n        Over the next 5 years, $4 billion is reserved within the NASA\\nbudget for the President\\'s new technology investment.  As a result,\\nstation options above $7 billion must be accompanied by offsetting\\nreductions in the rest of the NASA budget.  For example, a space station\\noption of $9 billion would require $2 billion in offsets from the NASA\\nbudget over the next 5 years.\\n\\n        Gibbons presented the information at an organizational session of\\nthe advisory committee.  Generally, the members-designate focused upon\\nadministrative topics and used the session to get acquainted.  They also\\nreceived a legal and ethics briefing and an orientation on the process the\\nStation Redesign Team is following to develop options for the advisory\\ncommittee to consider.\\n\\n        Gibbons also announced that the United States and its\\ninternational partners -- the Europeans, Japanese and Canadians -- have\\ndecided, after consultation, to give \"full consideration\" to use of\\nRussian assets in the course of the space station redesign process.\\n\\n        To that end, the Russians will be asked to participate in the\\nredesign effort on an as-needed consulting basis, so that the redesign\\nteam can make use of their expertise in assessing the capabilities of MIR\\nand the possible use of MIR and other Russian capabilities and systems.\\nThe U.S. and international partners hope to benefit from the expertise of\\nthe Russian participants in assessing Russian systems and technology.  The\\noverall goal of the redesign effort is to develop options for reducing\\nstation costs while preserving key research and exploration capabilitiaes.\\nCareful integration of Russian assets could be a key factor in achieving\\nthat goal.\\n\\n        Gibbons reiterated that, \"President Clinton is committed to the\\nredesigned space station and to making every effort to preserve the\\nscience, the technology and the jobs that the space station program\\nrepresents.  However, he also is committed to a space station that is well\\nmanaged and one that does not consume the national resources which should\\nbe used to invest in the future of this industry and this nation.\"\\n\\n        NASA Administrator Daniel S.  Goldin said the Russian\\nparticipation will be accomplished through the East-West Space Science\\nCenter at the University of Maryland under the leadership of Roald\\nSagdeev.',\n  '\\n\\n\\nSame in Sweden (the ergonomic keyboard is great, BUT!\\nthe palm rests do NOT fix to the keyboard; they just sort\\nof rests against the table.

The typical\\nX    start date for contests is in early March.  Contest rules are normally not\\nX    finalized and posted until the beginning of the contest.  The typical\\nX    closing date for contests are in early May.\\nX\\nX    The rules and the guidelines may (and often do) change from year to\\nX    year.

There\\n\"....contains inaccurate data and inconsistencies.\"   \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThanx in advance... Shaz....\\n\\n[I\\'m not sure quite what you mean by many different versions.\\nThe primary distinction in versions you see today is in the style\\nof the translation.  It\\'s pretty unusual to see significant\\ndifferences in meaning.  There are a few differences in the underlying\\ntext.  That\\'s because before printing, manuscripts were copied by\\nhand.  Slight differences resulted.  There are enough manuscripts\\naround that scholars can do a pretty good job of recreating the\\noriginal, but there are some uncertainties.  Fortunately, they are\\ngenerally at the level of minor differences in wording.  There are\\nsomething like 3 or 4 places where whole sentences are involved,\\nbut with recent discoveries of older manuscripts, I don\\'t think there\\'s\\nmuch uncertainly about those cases.  As far as I know, no Christians\\nbelieve that the process of copying manuscripts or the process of\\ntranslating is free of error.  But I also don\\'t think there\\'s\\nenough uncertainty in establishing the text or translating it that\\nit has much practical effect.\\n\\nWhether the Bible contains inaccurate data and inconsistences is a hot\\ntopic of debate here.  Many Christians deny it.  Some accept it\\n(though most would say that the inaccuracies involved are on details\\nthat don\\'t affect the faith).  But this has nothing to do with there\\nbeing multiple versions.  The supposed inconsistences can be found in\\nall the versions.  I\\'m surprised to find a reference to this on the\\ntitle page though.  What version are you talking about?  I\\'ve been\\nreferring to major scholarly translations.  These are what get\\nreferenced in postings here and elsewhere.  There have certainly been\\neditions that are (to be kind) less widely accepted.  This includes\\neverything from reconstructions that combine parallel accounts into\\nsingle narrations, to editions that omit material that the editor\\nobjects to for some reason or the other.  The copyright on the Bible\\nhas long since expired, so there nothing to stop people from making\\neditions that do whatever wierd thing they want.  However the editions\\nthat are widely used are carefully prepared by groups of scholars from\\na variety of backgrounds, with lots of crosschecks.  I could imagine\\none of the lesser-known editions claiming to have fixed up all\\ninaccurate data and inconsistencies.  But if so, it\\'s not any edition\\nthat\\'s widely used.  The widely used ones leave the text as is.\\n(Weeeeelllllll, almost as is.  It\\'s been alleged that a few\\ntranslations have fudged a word or two here and there to minimize\\ninconsistencies.

Traditionally, auditors do not like to get\\ninvolved in the design or operational aspects of things, and with good\\nreason.\\n\\nWhen I was a systems programmer, it always infuriated me that the\\nauditors would come in and tell us our implementation stunk from a\\nsecurity point of view, but wouldn\\'t tell us how to fix it.  I always\\nfigured they just liked to critcize, without doing the work to help fix\\nthe problem.\\n\\nThen I took a stint as an auditor, and I found out the real reason.\\nAuditors don\\'t like to recommend solutions, because it puts them in a\\nbad position if they have to criticize the implementation later.  The\\nauditee can say, \"Well, you told us this way would be OK.\"  It\\ncompromises the independence that is a necessary part of the auditor\\'s\\njob.\\n\\nTaking the case at hand, suppose ACLU becomes a key half registrar.\\nSuppose that, perhaps through some error on ACLU\\'s part, a key half gets\\naway that shouldn\\'t, and is used to deprive someone of her civil\\nliberties.

Compare the Northern\\n#  agricultural system with the Southern and you will see a major difference \\n#  in the capital to labor intensity.\\n\\nCapital and labor are one and the same in a slave economy.  Except that\\ncapital doesn\\'t reproduce quite as readily as slaves did.\\n\\nSlavery was a dying institution before the cotton gin, yes, but not\\nin 1850.\\n\\n# #It is true that cotton suffered from price depression in the 1840\\'s -\\n# #the period used to claim that slavery would not have lasted in the \\n# #South.  \\n# \\n# That is not the argument that I have heard. It would not have lasted because\\n#  the growth in the North would not have been sustained for much longer without\\n#  spilling over to the Southern states, i.e. Northern industry would have \\n#  migrated capital to the Southern states, and with that would have come \\n#  immigrant labor to the ports of the South, e.g. Charleston, Savannah, Mobile,\\n#  New Orleans, etc. This would have put the breaks on the slave market and\\n#  slavery would have been out-moded by the capital intensity of competing \\n#  agriculturalists.

Simple capital to labor ratio...read Michael Parkin _Microeconomics_\\n#  2nd edition, and any other basic economics book.\\n\\nThis assumes that the slave holder dominance over state governments\\nwould not have caused the passage of laws to keep out capital from the\\nNorth.  Since slave holders were prepared to do almost anything else\\nto destroy free markets in order to maintain slavery, I do not doubt\\nthat they would have passed laws to cripple any serious competitive\\nthreat.

As far as my\\n[SY] grandparents are concerned, the Armenians attacked first but these \\n[SY] Armenians were not their neighbors. They came from other places. Maybe \\n[SY] first they had a training at some place. They were taught to kill people,\\n[SY] to hate Turks/Kurds? It seems so...\\n\\nThere is certainly a difference between the planned extermination of the\\nArmenians of eastern Turkey beginning in 1915, with that of the Armeno-\\nGeorgian conflicts of late 1918! The argument is not whether Armenians ever \\nkilled in their collective existence, but rather the wholesale destruction of\\nAnatolian Armenians under orders of the Turkish government. An Armenian-\\nGeorgian dispute over the disposition of Akhalkalak, Lori, and Pambak after\\nthe Turkish Third Army evacuated the region, cannot be equated with the\\nextermination of Anatolian Armenians. Many Armenians and Georgians died\\nin this area in the scramble to re-occupy these lands and the lack of\\npreparation for the winter months. This is not the same as the Turkish \\ngenocide of the Armenians nearly four years earlier, hundreds of kilometers\\naway!\\n\\n[SY] Anyway, but after they killed/raped/... Turks and other muslim people\\n[SY] around, people assumed that 'Armenians killed us, raped our women',\\n[SY] not a particular group of people trained in some camps, maybe backed\\n[SY] by some powerful states... After that step, you cannot explain these \\n[SY] people not to hate all Armenians. \\n\\nI don't follow, perhaps the next paragraph will shed some light.\\n\\n[SY] So what am I trying to point out? First, at least for that region,\\n[SY] you cannot blame Turks/Kurds etc since it was a self defense situation.\\n[SY] Most of the Armenians, I think, are not to blame either. But since some\\n[SY] people started that fire, it is not easy to undo it. There are facts.\\n[SY] People cannot trust eachother easily. It is very difficult to establish\\n[SY] a good relation based on mutual respect and trust between nations with\\n[SY] different ethnic/cultural/religious backgrounds but it is unfortunately\\n[SY] very easy to start a fire!\\n\\nAgain, the fighting between Armenians and Georgians in 1918/19 had little to\\ndo with the destruction of the Armenians in Turkey. It is interesting that\\nthe Georgian leaders of the Transcaucasian Federation (Armenia, Azerbaijan, \\nand Georgia) made special deals with Turkish generals not to pass through \\nTiflis on their way to Baku, in return for Georgians not helping the Armenians \\nmilitarily. Of course, as Turkish troops marched across what was left of\\nCaucasian Armenia, many Armenians went north and such population movement \\ncaused problems with the locals.

Opening\\nstatements were given by both the prosecution and the defense,\\neach side presenting its version of what happenned last August.\\n\\nThe prosecution argued that Weaver and his family moved to\\nIdaho in 1983 anticipating a battle with the \"evil\" federal\\ngovernment.  The prosecution alleges that Weaver sold federal\\nagents \"sawed off\" shotguns and later failed to appear for\\ntrial: Despite repeated \"good faith\" efforts to get Weaver\\nto surrender peacefully, Weaver refused.  The shootout erupted\\nwhen Weaver discovered agents on a surveillance mission and\\nbegan firing.  According to the prosecution, three people\\nwere taking an \"offensive action\" against an FBI helicopter\\nwhen an FBI sniper killed Vicki Weaver.\\n\\nThe defense argued that Weaver and his family moved to northern\\nIdaho in 1983 to practice their religion in peace.  They wanted\\nsimply to be left alone.  Weaver was induced by federal agents to\\nsell the short-barrelled shotgun (and did not, as the prosecution\\nalleged, want to become a \"regular supplier\").  The defense also\\nargued that the federal government sought to arrest Weaver when\\nhe wouldn\\'t become an informant [it is not specified explicitly,\\nbut I assume that this is a reference to the white separatist\\nangle of the story.  We\\'ll know more as things develop].  The\\nfailure to appear in court happenned because Weaver was given\\nan incorrect court date and then indicted before that date.\\nThe shootout occurred when federal agent Arthur Roderick killed\\nWeaver\\'s dog that was in proximity to Weaver\\'s son, Samuel.  Weaver\\nthen fired in self-defense.  In the ensuing battle, federal\\nagent William Degan was killed (when his gun was later found,\\nthere were 7 .223 cases nearby and the gun was on semi-automatic:\\nHowever, agents were near the body for an extended period of\\ntime and could have played with the select-fire - this will\\nhave to be more fully explained).  Finally, the defense claims\\nthat Vicki Weaver was only going to \"look at the body\" [not recover?]\\nof her son when she was cut-down by an FBI sniper.\\n\\nProsecution quote: \"Weaver wanted that confrontation, and he made\\nthat confrontation.\" -- Asst. U.S. Attorney Kim Lindquist\\n\\nDefense quote: \"The evidence in this case is going to show that\\nthis is a case where Randy Weaver and Kevin Harris are charged\\nwith crimes they didn\\'t commit in order to cover crimes that\\nthe government did commit.\"  -- Gerry Spence  [nice soundbite!]\\n\\nNotes: The _Idaho Statesman_ claims that Weaver supporters\\nheeded a call from Spence not to repeat yesterday\\'s protests\\noutside the courthouse.  However, the local NBC affiliate\\nagain had footage on the 10:00 news with 5 supporters including\\n\"Tim\" again.  \"Tim\" claimed he was a skinhead, who were \"ordinary,\\nworking class people.\"  He also claimed he was for \"white pride,\\nnot white power.\"\\n\\nOutside the courthouse the television crew had an impromptu interview\\nwith Bo Gritz, who charged that the neo-nazi protestors are exactly\\nwhat the government wants to smear Randy Weaver.\\n\\nIn an affiliated article carried in the _Idaho Statesman_, about\\na dozen lawyers were among the 70 or so people packed into the\\ncourthouse.  These lawyers were present to watch Gerry Spence\\nin action, and to perhaps learn something from him.  Some\\ntidbits: Spence flatly told the jurors that he and his son Kent\\nwere volunteering their time to represent Weaver because they\\nbelieved in him.  Spence, during his 90-minute opening statement,\\nrepeatedly walked behind Weaver and placed his hands on the\\ndefendants shoulders (Weaver broke down and cried during the\\nrecounting of his wife\\'s death), and Spence compared the \"sawed\\noff\" shotgun to driving 56 mph when the limit was 55 (another\\ngood one!).\\n\\nToday (Thursday, April 15th) the prosecution was scheduled to\\nbegin presenting evidence.\\n\\nDrew\\n=============================================================\\n\\n',\n  '\\nCNN=YuppieTV\\n\\n                  tom coradeschi &lt;+&gt; tcora@pica.army.mil',\n  '\\n\\nActually I admired the spirit of the fan at the Cubs opener several years\\nago who held up a sign that said \"Wait Till Next Year\".\\n',\n  'massacre.\\n\\nAnswer: a(1-1/2-1/4-1/11)=280 -&gt; a = 1760',\n  'they are pretty much junk, stay away from them.  they will be replaced next\\nyear with all new models.  \\n',\n  '\\n  While Atlanta has the undisputed best starting rotation, I feel that their\\nrelief staff may be suspect.

On April 19, a NO-OP command was sent to reset the command loss timer to\\n264 hours, its planned value during this mission phase.\\n\\n4.  On April 21, the first of two suppressed carrier/DSN (Deep Space Network)\\nadvanced receiver characterization tests was performed over DSS-14 (Goldstone\\n70 meter antenna).  The spacecraft modulation index was varied from 43 degrees\\nto 90 degrees for a range of ground receiver bandwidth settings.\\n\\n5.  The AC bus imbalance measurement has not exhibited significant change\\n(greater than 25 DN) throughout this period but the DC bus imbalance\\nmeasurement has.  The AC measurement reads 20 DN (4.5 volts).  The DC\\nmeasurement has ranged from 43 DN (4.6 volts) to 138 DN (16.2 volts) and\\ncurrently reads 138 DN (16.2 volts).

I think this thread has already been discussed...season ticket\\nholders in LA don\\'t always use their tickets.  So in effect, after the Kings\\ninitial success following Gretzky\\'s arrival (68 to 91 points, same source)\\nand corresponding attendance jump, there has been an effective drop in\\nattendance even though ticket sales may not have changed much.  \\n\\nWhether or not the Kings are a \\'winner\\' is debatable.  I claim that since\\nGretzky\\'s arrival they have at the very least been competitive...I also claim\\nthat McNall has made a stupid move in trying to reassemble the Oiler\\ndynasty...but that\\'s another story and included only because I don\\'t like\\nMcNall:-).  Anyway,  McNall did do some heavy marketing around Gretzky, and\\nthat undoubtedly was also responsible for the attendance and merchandising\\nsales, etc.  But as I said, when the Kings have been in there little\\ntailspins over the past couple of years there have been empty seats at the\\nForum even if the tickets were sold.\\n\\n\\nFor the short term, IMO.

Rather than use technology to accommodate\\nthe sometimes competing interests of economic growth, privacy and\\nlaw enforcement, previous policies have pitted government against\\nindustry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement.\\n\\nSophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to\\nprotect electronic funds transfer.  It is now being used to\\nprotect electronic mail and computer files.  While encryption\\ntechnology can help Americans protect business secrets and the\\nunauthorized release of personal information, it also can be used\\nby terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.\\n\\nA state-of-the-art microcircuit called the \"Clipper Chip\" has\\nbeen developed by government engineers.  The chip represents a\\nnew approach to encryption technology.  It can be used in new,\\nrelatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to\\nan ordinary telephone.  It scrambles telephone communications\\nusing an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in\\ncommercial use today.\\n\\nThis new technology will help companies protect proprietary\\ninformation, protect the privacy of personal phone conversations\\nand prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted\\nelectronically.  At the same time this technology preserves the\\nability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to\\nintercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals. \\n\\nA \"key-escrow\" system will be established to ensure that the\\n\"Clipper Chip\" is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding\\nAmericans.  Each device containing the chip will have two unique\\n\\n\\n                                2\\n\\n\\n\"keys,\" numbers that will be needed by authorized government\\nagencies to decode messages encoded by the device.  When the\\ndevice is manufactured, the two keys will be deposited separately\\nin two \"key-escrow\" data bases that will be established by the\\nAttorney General.  Access to these keys will be limited to\\ngovernment officials with legal authorization to conduct a\\nwiretap.\\n\\nThe \"Clipper Chip\" technology provides law enforcement with no\\nnew authorities to access the content of the private\\nconversations of Americans.\\n\\nTo demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, the\\nAttorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new\\ndevices.  In addition, respected experts from outside the\\ngovernment will be offered access to the confidential details of\\nthe algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report\\ntheir findings.\\n\\nThe chip is an important step in addressing the problem of\\nencryption\\'s dual-edge sword:  encryption helps to protect the\\nprivacy of individuals and industry, but it also can shield\\ncriminals and terrorists.  We need the \"Clipper Chip\" and other\\napproaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with access\\nto the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it\\nto hide their illegal activities.  In order to assess technology\\ntrends and explore new approaches (like the key-escrow system),\\nthe President has directed government agencies to develop a\\ncomprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates:\\n\\n     --   the privacy of our citizens, including the need to\\n          employ voice or data encryption for business purposes;\\n\\n     --   the ability of authorized officials to access telephone\\n          calls and data, under proper court or other legal\\n          order, when necessary to protect our citizens;\\n\\n     --   the effective and timely use of the most modern\\n          technology to build the National Information\\n          Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and\\n          the competitiveness of American industry in the global\\n          marketplace; and \\n\\n     --   the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export\\n          high technology products.\\n\\nThe President has directed early and frequent consultations with\\naffected industries, the Congress and groups that advocate the\\nprivacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed.\\n\\n\\n\\n                                3\\n\\nThe Administration is committed to working with the private\\nsector to spur the development of a National Information\\nInfrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer\\ntechnologies to give Americans unprecedented access to\\ninformation.  This infrastructure of high-speed networks\\n(\"information superhighways\") will transmit video, images, HDTV\\nprogramming, and huge data files as easily as today\\'s telephone\\nsystem transmits voice.\\n\\nSince encryption technology will play an increasingly important\\nrole in that infrastructure, the Federal Government must act\\nquickly to develop consistent, comprehensive policies regarding\\nits use.  The Administration is committed to policies that\\nprotect all Americans\\' right to privacy while also protecting\\nthem from those who break the law.\\n\\nFurther information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet. \\nThe provisions of the President\\'s directive to acquire the new\\nencryption technology are also available.  \\n\\nFor additional details, call Mat Heyman, National Institute of\\nStandards and Technology, (301) 975-2758.\\n\\n---------------------------------\\n\\n\\nQUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION\\'S\\nTELECOMMUNICATIONS INITIATIVE\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nQ:   Does this approach expand the authority of government\\n     agencies to listen in on phone conversations?\\n\\nA:   No.  \"Clipper Chip\" technology provides law enforcement with\\n     no new authorities to access the content of the private\\n     conversations of Americans.\\n\\nQ:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on\\n     a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation\\n     encrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to\\n     decipher the message?\\n\\nA:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a\\n     court order, to do the wiretap in the first place.  They\\n     would then present documentation of this authorization to\\n     the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and\\n     obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug\\n     smugglers.  The key is split into two parts, which are\\n     stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key\\n     escrow system.\\n\\nQ:   Who will run the key-escrow data banks?\\n\\nA:   The two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent\\n     entities.  At this point, the Department of Justice and the\\n     Administration have yet to determine which agencies will\\n     oversee the key-escrow data banks.\\n\\nQ:   How strong is the security in the device?  How can I be sure\\n     how strong the security is?  \\n\\nA:   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption\\n     systems readily available today.  While the algorithm will\\n     remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow\\n     system, we are willing to invite an independent panel of\\n     cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all\\n     potential users that there are no unrecognized\\n     vulnerabilities.\\n\\nQ:   Whose decision was it to propose this product?\\n\\nA:   The National Security Council, the Justice Department, the\\n     Commerce Department, and other key agencies were involved in\\n     this decision.  This approach has been endorsed by the\\n     President, the Vice President, and appropriate Cabinet\\n     officials.\\n\\nQ:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry?\\n\\nA:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on\\n     encryption issues, and expect those discussions to intensify\\n     as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have\\n     briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the\\n     decisions related to this initiative.\\n\\nQ:   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers?\\n\\nA:   The government designed and developed the key access\\n     encryption microcircuits, but it is not providing the\\n     microcircuits to product manufacturers.  Product\\n     manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip\\n     manufacturer that produces them.\\n\\nQ:   Who provides the \"Clipper Chip\"?\\n\\nA:   Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance,\\n     California, and will sell the chip to encryption device\\n     manufacturers.  The programming function could be licensed\\n     to other vendors in the future.\\n\\nQ:   How do I buy one of these encryption devices? \\n\\nA:   We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating\\n     the \"Clipper Chip\" into their devices.\\n     \\nQ:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological\\n     solution like the one proposed, would the Administration be\\n     willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more\\n     powerful encryption devices?\\n\\nA:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be\\n     considered during the broad policy review.  The key escrow\\n     mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product\\n     that is more secure, more convenient, and less expensive\\n     than others readily available today, but it is just one\\n     piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to\\n     encryption technology, which the Administration is\\n     developing.\\n\\n     The Administration is not saying, \"since encryption\\n     threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,\\n     we will prohibit it outright\" (as some countries have\\n     effectively done); nor is the U.S. saying that \"every\\n     American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an\\n     unbreakable commercial encryption product.\"  There is a\\n     false \"tension\" created in the assessment that this issue is\\n     an \"either-or\" proposition.  Rather, both concerns can be,\\n     and in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned,\\n     balanced approach such as is proposed with the \"Clipper\\n     Chip\" and similar encryption techniques.\\n\\nQ:   What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton\\n     Administration\\'s policy toward encryption will differ from\\n     that of the Bush Administration?  \\n\\nA:   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption\\n     technology in telecommunications and computing and are\\n     committed to working with industry and public-interest\\n     groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans\\'\\n     privacy, help businesses to compete, and ensure that law\\n     enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime\\n     and terrorism.\\n\\nQ:   Will the devices be exportable?  Will other devices that use\\n     the government hardware?\\n\\nA:   Voice encryption devices are subject to export control\\n     requirements.  Case-by-case review for each export is\\n     required to ensure appropriate use of these devices.  The\\n     same is true for other encryption devices.  One of the\\n     attractions of this technology is the protection it can give\\n     to U.S. companies operating at home and abroad.  With this\\n     in mind, we expect export licenses will be granted on a\\n     case-by-case basis for U.S. companies seeking to use these\\n     devices to secure their own communications abroad.  We plan\\n     to review the possibility of permitting wider exportability\\n     of these products.\\n\\n----------- End included article ----------- \\n',\n  \"Hi,\\n\\tWe've been having problems on a few setups when printing to a\\nserial printer (dmp or Laser).

For there to \\nbe any net benefit, you would have to show that gun control measures\\nwould disarm over 40% of the criminals currently using guns.\\nThat would be very hard to do: According the the federal BATF,\\nonly 8% of criminals buy their guns over the counter. Since\\ngun control laws, by their very nature, only effect legal\\nsales, such a law would remove all the benefits of armed,\\nlaw-abiding citizens while having only a minimal effect on\\narmed criminals (who, by and large, get their guns illegally.) \\nThat doesn\\'t sound like a net benefit to me.\\n  \\n\\nSince most were with licensed weapons, I assume you are not\\nsupporting \"reasonable\" laws (i.e. waiting periods, background\\nchecks, licenses, etc...). Since only a complete ban would \\nalter the statistic you refer to, I assume that\\'s what you\\nare supporting.\\n\\nBy the way, 1135 people dies in 1986 from falling down stairs.\\n250 accidental handgun deaths isn\\'t significant next to \\nother household accidents.\\n\\n\\n1080 children under the age of 10 died by drowning, 69 from \\ndrinking poisonous household chemicals (like Drano), 139 from\\nfalls. If the real goal is to reduce the tragic, accidental\\ndeaths of children, wouldn\\'t a ban on drain cleaners be a \\nbetter palce to start? (Or, perhaps, restricting ownership to\\nprofessionals like plumbers?)\\n\\n\\nWhile you might call it \"emphasis\", refering to completely two\\nstatistics in the same sentence _implies_ a comparison. If it\\nisn\\'t valid, and you put the numbers together to convince people\\nyou are right, the kindest thing I could call it is propaganda.',\n  \"Hi all,\\n\\nI'm an assistant manager at a local art theater here in Columbus.  I'd\\nlike to expand our show automation a bit- namely add the capability to\\nuse cue tapes to bring the houselights up.  Our current automation\\nconsoles date from the early 60's and don't provide this function.\\n\\nWe already have the combo failsafe/contact rollers to read the cuetapes,\\nand our dimmer system will raise the houselights when its fade-up control\\ncircuit (120 VAC) is momentarily closed, for at least 0.5 second.\\n\\nI've tried wiring the dimmer control to a 12V relay, activated when the\\ncue tape completes the circuit.  Low tech and simple, but there's one\\nproblem:  In order to get the 1/2 second pulse, there needs to be\\na sh**load of cuetape on the film.  (35mm runs at 90 feet per minute,\\nso to get a 1/2 second pulse, there needs to be at least 9 inches of solid\\ncuetape!)\\n\\nIdeally, I would like to use a single cross-cue to accomplish this function.\\n(A single strip of cuetape perpendicular to the length of the film)\\nThis would give a pulse of approximately 1/100 of a second.\\nWhat I need is a circuit to detect the short cue and activate the relay\\nfor around 1/2 second.  The ability to adjust how long the relay\\nis activated would be nice.  I figure this would require an RC circuit\\nof some sort.

That means if the Isles\\nbeat the Devils on Friday, the will meet the Caps in the playoffs.\\n\\n\\tHowever, I have some more comments on the Islanders and hockey in\\ngeneral that I need to get off my chest :).  First of all, with the Islanders \\nback-to-back lackluster performances against the Whalers, one may think that \\nthe Islanders are out of shape.  These guys always suck wind in the 2nd period,\\ncome on a little in the 3rd and run out of gas too soon.  It is unbelieveable\\nhow many one goal games these guys have lost.  Anyway, the games was pretty \\nwide open.  The Isles still have tons of trouble scoring.  The Whalers played \\na golie in is 1st NHL start, I think his name was Lenarduzzi (sp?).  (His NHL \\ndebut was the Tuesday tie against the Isles).  Like I mentioned before, this \\nguy looked like the best golie on the planet for a while (until he misplayed a \\nMahlakov slap shot to go to OT).  I say it\\'s because the Isles don\\'t shoot \\ncorrectly.  Has anyone else noticed this?\\n\\n\\tAlso, I think it is really a shame for hockey when I guy like Mick\\nVukota gets as much ice time as he does.  This guy has about as much hockey\\ntalent as Jiggs MacDonald (who did play hockey, I think).  Anytime he gets the\\npuck it gets stolen, and he always starts fights and gets needless penalties. \\nRichard Pilon is another guy who is on the ice to stir up crap.  And he\\'s a\\ndefenseman.  He\\'s got to be approaching negative infinity for his plus/minus. \\nThis guy gets beaten all the time.  Why the need for such \"enforcers\"?  Not\\nonly do fights slow the game down ALOT, but it takes away from the guys who are\\nreally trying to play the game.  I\\'ll be one of the few to admit, I do enjoy a \\ngood fight once in a while, but only when it\\'s \"called for\".  You know, when a\\nguy checks the goalie too hard.  In other words, a violation of \"hockey ethics\"\\nmight cause you to get puched.  But there is no need to start crap when you are\\nlosing or becuase you can get away with it!!

The SK theater. They were showing an Argentinian film, \"The Abyss.\" \\nBefore the film we noticed about 60 to 70 people standing near the podium at \\nthe City Party Committee, but they were silent, there\\'s no conversation \\nwhatsoever, and we couldn\\'t figure out what was going on. That is, we knew it \\nwas about Karabagh, but what it was exactly, what they were talking about, if \\nsomeone gave a speech or not, we didn\\'t know. We bought our tickets. There \\nwere 30 or 40 people in the theater. This was a very small number for that \\nlarge movie theater. The film started. About 30 minutes later they stopped the\\nfilm. A crowd burst in. About 60 people. They came up onto the stage. Well \\nmostly they were young people, from 16 to 23 years old. They demanded that an \\nArmenian woman come up onto the stage. They used foul language and said that \\nthey were going to show what Azerbaijanis were capable of, what they could do \\nto Armenian girls. I thought that\\'s what they meant because they had demanded \\na girl specifically. Marina and I were sitting together. I told her to move \\nover, there were some Russian girls sitting nearby. So that if someone \\nrecognized me or if something happened, they would take me, and not Marina. \\nIt got quiet, 2 or 3 girls jumped up to run out, but the door was closed--it\\'s\\nonly opened at the end of the   show--and they returned to their seats. \\nEveryone in the theater was looking at one another, Russians, Azerbaijanis, \\npeople of various nationalities. But no one reacted at all, no one in the \\nauditorium made a sound. They were silent, looking at one another, and \\ngradually started to leave. Some guy, a really fat one, says, \"OK, we\\'ve \\nscared them enough, let\\'s leave.\" They leave slowly, pompously. It seemed to \\nme that those people were not themselves. Either they had smoked a bunch of \\n\"anasha\", or had taken something else, because they all looked beastly, like \\nthey were ready to tear anyone apart. Then it was all over, as though nothing \\nhad happened at all. The film started up again, it was one of those cheerful \\nfilms which should have only brought pleasure, made you happy to be alive. We \\ncould barely sit to the end. So it had started at seven it was over by nine, \\nand it was dark . . .\\n\\nMarina and I were walking home, Lenin Street, that\\'s the center of town. Lenin\\nStreet was packed, just packed with young people. They were shouting, \\nsomething about Karabagh and something about Armenians. We weren\\'t especially \\nlistening, because the way we were feeling we didn\\'t know if we were going to \\nmake it home or not, and just what had happened anyway? Public transportation \\nwasn\\'t running. Incidentally, when we came out of the theater we saw police, \\npolicemen standing there. The director of the movie theater was looking at the\\ndoors, because when they were leaving they had broken the glass, the doors \\nthere are basically all glass. Everything was broken. He stood there grief-\\nstricken, but looking as though nothing really big had happened, like some \\nnaughty boys had just broken them quite by accident, with a slingshot. Well, \\nsince he looked more or less calm I decided that, nothing all that super \\nserious had happened. We went out very slowly; we wanted to catch a bus, we \\nlive literally one stop away. We didn\\'t want to go on foot, not because it was\\ndark, but because something might happen. We flagged down a cab, but the \\ndriver didn\\'t want to take us. We told him we live near the bus station, and \\nhe said he\\'d take us to the bus station and not a yard farther. I said, well, \\nOK . . .\\n\\nSo we got into the cab and managed to get there. Something incredible was \\nhappening at the bus station. There was a traffic jam. Public transportation \\nwas at a standstill and everyone was shouting \"Ka-ra-bagh,\" they\\'re not going \\nto give up Karabagh. I go home and tell my family what\\'s going on, and there\\'s\\nimmediate panic in the house. Mamma says, what should we do? Like the end had \\ncome, they were going to come, kill us, that\\'s it . . . Somehow we managed to \\ncheer ourselves up: Nothing that bad could happen. Where are we living anyway,\\njust what kind of social order do we have? Somehow we manage to calm Mamma \\ndown. And we went to bed. But no one could sleep. Everyone made as though \\nnothing had happened.\\n\\nThat was on Saturday. In short, the day went by. We didn\\'t go anywhere and \\ndidn\\'t call our relatives. No one did anything. Because . . . life goes on.\\nThat day I realized something was approaching, but what exactly, I couldn\\'t\\nguess.\\n\\nOn the 28th everything was like it was supposed to be, we lived like we always\\nhad. There were five of us at home: Mamma, Papa and us, three sisters: Lyuda, \\nMarina, and I. My sister Lyuda was in Yerevan at the time. We sat at home and \\nno one went out. Later we learned that a demonstration had started that \\nmorning. It all started . . . They were smashing up stores. We were sitting at\\nhome and didn\\'t know anything about it. Then a girlfriend of mine, Lyuda \\nZimogliad, came by at around three o\\'clock I think. We worked together, we did\\nour apprenticeships together, she\\'s a Russian girl. She said that something\\nawful was happening in town. I asked, \"Don\\'t they want Armenians? Well what \\nare they after, if they\\'re already in that state?\" She says, no, nothing like \\nthat, it\\'s just a demonstration, but it\\'s awful to watch it. Somehow, it feels\\nlike a war has broken out. Public transportation has been stopped . . . The \\ncabs, the buses, well it\\'s just a nightmare.\\n\\nThen Papa decides to go to the drugstore, my mother was having allergy \\nproblems at the time . . . He left the house and our neighbor, Aunt Vera,\\nasked him, \"Where are you going? Stop! There are such terrible things going\\non in the courtyard; aren\\'t you afraid to go out?\" Papa didn\\'t know what she\\nwas talking about. She simply pushed him back into the entryway. He came home \\nand told Mamma. Mamma said, \"Well, if Aunt Vera was talking like that it means\\nthat something is really going on.\" But we didn\\'t go see her, she\\'s a Russian,\\nshe lives across from us. I had to see my friend out. Around five o\\'clock I \\ntell Lyuda, \"Ok, look, it\\'s time for you to go, it\\'s late already, I\\'ll see \\nyou out.\" Mamma says, \"You don\\'t need to go, it\\'s too late already, you can \\nsee what the situation in town is.\" So we decided to stay home. Dinner was \\nready. Mamma says, \"Let her eat with us, then she can go.\" We sat down at the \\ntable. But no one was hungry, no one was in the mood, we just put everything \\nout on the table to calm ourselves down, and make it appear that we\\'re eating.\\nWe turned on the television, and the show \"In Fairy-Tale Land\" was coming on. \\nWe cleared the table.\\n\\nWe hear some noise out in the courtyard. I go out on the balcony, but I can\\'t \\nsee what\\'s going on, because the noise is coming from the direction of the bus\\nstation, and there is a 9-story building in the way. There is mob of people \\n. . . I can\\'t figure out what\\'s happening. They\\'re shouting something, looking\\nsomewhere, I can\\'t make out what is going on. I go down to a neighbor, she\\'s \\nan Azerbaijani; we\\'ve been friends of her family for about 25 years. I go down\\nto look from their place. I see people shouting, looking at the 5-and 9-story \\nbuildings near the bus station. Just then soldiers set upon them, about 20 \\npeople, with clubs. The mob runs off in different directions. I even see \\nseveral people from our building. They are looking and laughing . . . I decide\\nthat means it\\'s not all that bad if they are laughing: it means they\\'re not \\nkilling anyone. But now the crowd suddenly dashes toward the soldiers. One of \\nthe soldiers cannot manage to get away, they start stomping on him with their \\nfeet, everyone\\'s kicking him . . . I become ill and go home, and explain in \\ngeneral terms that horrible things are going on out there . . .  can\\'t speak\\n. . . Well, they\\'ve probably killed that soldier, the way that crowd is . . .\\nIf each of them kicked him just once . . . They took his club away from him\\nand started to beat him with it. But it was far away and I couldn\\'t see if he\\ngot up and left or not.\\n\\nI become terrified and go home and say, \"Lyuda, don\\'t go anywhere, stay at our\\nplace, because if you go out they could kill you or . . . \" Then the crowd \\nruns over closer toward our building and stands at the 12-story building and \\nstarts shouting something. We go out onto the balcony. All of our neighbors \\nare also out on theirs, too. Everyone is standing, staring. The mob is \\nshouting and about 5 minutes later comes running toward our building. As it \\nturns out, at the 12-story building the Azerbaijani neighbors went down and \\nkept them from coming in. There\\'s only one entryway there, they could stop \\nthem.\\n\\nThey all run up to our building. Mamma immediately starts closing the windows,\\nafraid that they might throw stones. They have stones and they break the \\nwindows, all of them. There are very many people. We have a large courtyard, \\nand it\\'s packed with people. They spill up to the first floor so they don\\'t \\ncrush each other. They crawl up on trees, posts, and garages. It\\'s just a huge\\ncloud of people. They break and burn the motorcycle of the Armenian Sergey \\nSargisian, from our building. We close the windows and immediately hear \\ntramping in our entryway. They come up to our fifth floor with a tremendous \\ndin and roar. It\\'s incomprehensible. Mamma told me later that they were \\nshouting Father\\'s name, \"Grisha, open the door, we\\'ve come to kill you!,\" or\\nsomething like that. I don\\'t remember that, I was spaced out, kind of. Mamma \\nsays, \"Into the bedroom, quickly!\" In the bedroom we have two tall beds, part \\nof our dowry; Mamma says, \"Hide there, they probably won\\'t come in there, \\nthey\\'ll ask something, say something, and leave.\" She says, \"We\\'ll tell them \\nthat we live alone here.\" I can\\'t imagine that my parents will stand out in \\nthe hall alone talking with some sort of beasts . . . I go to them and say \\nthat I\\'ll stand together with them, I\\'ll talk with them if they come, maybe I \\ncan find a common language with them, all the more so if they know me: I speak \\nAzerbaijani more or less, and I can find out what they want. I told Marina and\\nLyuda to hide under the bed, and my sister Lyuda, I can\\'t remember if I told \\nher anything or not.\\n\\nThen . . . they open the door: it\\'s like they blew on it and it broke and fell\\nright into the hall. The crows bursts in and starts to shout: Get out of here,\\nleave, vacate the apartment and go back to your Armenia; things like that. I\\ntell them, \"What has happened, speak calmly. One of you, tell me, calmly, what\\nhas happened.\" In Azerbaijani, they say, \"Get out of the apartment, leave.\" I \\nsay, \"OK. Go downstairs. We\\'ll gather everything we need and leave the \\napartment.\" I realize that it is senseless to discuss any sort of rights with\\nthem, these are animals. They must be stopped. The ones standing in the\\ndoorway, the young guys, say, \"There are old people and one girl with them.\\nToo bad!\" They take two or three steps back. It seems as though I have\\npacified them with our exchange. Then someone in the courtyard shouts, \\ncommanding them: \"Don\\'t you understand what you are saying? Kill them?\"\\n\\nAnd that was it! That was all it took. They grab Papa, carry him into one\\nroom, and Mamma and me into another. They put Mamma on the bed and start \\nundressing her, beating her legs. They start tearing my clothes, right there, \\nin front of Mamma. I don\\'t remember where they went, what they did, or how \\nmuch time passed. I had the feeling that they beat me on the head, on my body,\\nand tore my clothes, all at the same time, I don\\'t even know what I said. The \\natrocities started. I was savagely raped in that room. They argued among \\nthemselves who would go first.\\n\\nLater, I remember, I came to. I don\\'t know if I\\'m dead or alive. Someone comes\\nin, someone tall, I think, clean-shaven, in an Eskimo dogskin coat, balding. \\nHe looks around at what\\'s happening. At that instant everything stops. It \\nseems to me that he is either their commander or . . . that somehow everything\\ndepends on him. He looks and says, \"Well, we\\'re done here.\" They are beating\\nMamma on the head. They break up the chairs and beat her with the chair legs \\n. . . She loses consciousness, and they decide that she\\'s dead. Papa . . . was\\nout cold. They want to throw Lyuda off the balcony, but they can\\'t get the \\nwindow open. Apparently the window frames are stuck after the rain and the \\nwindows can\\'t be opened. They leave her next to the window. She was thinking \\nabout being thrown out the window and passed out. She\\'s not a real strong \\nperson anyway . . . He looks at me and sees that I\\'m saying something, that\\nI\\'m still twitching. Well, I start saying the opposite of what I should be, \\nwhich is humbling myself and pleading. I start shouting, cursing . . . they \\ndon\\'t get any entreaty out of me. I  already know that I\\'m dead, why would I \\nhumble myself before anyone? And he says that if that\\'s what I think, since my\\ntongue is so long . . . maybe he thinks that I still look quite appealing \\n. . . In short, he commands that I be taken outside.\\n\\nI no longer saw or remembered what was happening to Marina and Lyuda, I don\\'t \\nknow if they are alive or not. They take me outside. They are dragging me by \\nmy arms, by my legs. They are hitting me against the wall, the railings, \\nsomething metal . . . While they are carrying me someone is biting me, someone\\nelse is pinching me . . .I don\\'t even know. I think, my God, when will death \\ncome? If only it were sooner . . . Then . . . they carry me out, throw me near\\nthe entryway . . . and start kicking me. I lose consciousness . . . What \\nhappened after that, how many people there were, I don\\'t remember.\\n \\nI come to after a while, I don\\'t remember how long. A neighbor is bringing me \\nclothing. I\\'m entirely covered with blood, she puts a dress on me. I remember \\nthat I said the same words over and over again: \"Mamma, what happened, Mamma, \\nwhat have they done to us, where are we, whose house are we at?\" I can\\'t make \\nsense out of anything. There is a guy standing over me, I sort of know him, he\\nserved in Afghanistan, his name is Igor, he brought me indoors. When they all \\nwent to the third entryway and killed a person there, Igor gathered his \\ncourage, took me into his arms, and brought me to the neighbors\\', even though \\nhe\\'s small-minded, he put himself at risk. Igor Agayev is Azerbaijani; he \\nserved in Afghanistan. There are three brothers. The older brother also served\\nthere, I think; now he\\'s stationed here, on the border, in Armenia. Igor \\nbrought me to the neighbors\\', and then helped me come to my senses, saying, \\n\"Karina, I know you, calm down, I\\'m not one of them.\" How do I know who\\'s who \\nand what\\'s what? I come to, and they clean me up. I was covered in blood. Then\\nPapa . . . I saw Papa, I saw Mamma. And Marina, too . . . Igor was there when \\nthey dragged Marina and Lyuda out from under the bed . . . Marina . . . Lyuda \\nsaid that she was Russian, they said, we\\'ll let you go, we aren\\'t touching the\\nRussians, go. And while they are dragging Marina out she decides she\\'s going \\nto tell them she\\'s Azerbaijani. Igor immediately grabs Marina\\'s and Lyuda\\'s \\nhands, because he knows Marina, and knows that she is Armenian and is our \\nsister, and takes her to the second floor to a neighbor\\'s and starts pounding \\non the door so she will open up. She opens the door and Igor pushes them in \\nthere. So they survived.\\n\\nMy sister Lyuda lost consciousness after the bandits started stealing things.\\nWhile they were going downstairs, taking things downstairs, then coming back \\nup again, Lyuda seized the opportunity and crawled under the bed and stayed \\nthere. Then, when she was herself again, she found a torn night shirt and put \\nit on, and some sort of robe and went to a neighbor\\'s on the fourth floor, the\\none whose apartment I had watched the crowd from, the friend of ours, and \\nknocked on the door. The neighbor opened and said, \"I\\'m not going to let you \\nin the apartment because I\\'m afraid of them. But I\\'ll give you some stockings \\nand we\\'ll leave the building.\" Lyuda says, \"I\\'ll stay at your place because of\\nwhat\\'s going on, they keep going up and down the stairs.\" It was just for a \\nmoment, just a moment in life, but the neighbor wouldn\\'t consent. Lyuda came \\nback to our place and lay under the bed . . .\\n\\nI came to. Mother was there. I can\\'t remember my supervisor\\'s telephone \\nnumber, but something had to be done. Somehow I remembered and called, and he \\ncame to get us. He didn\\'t have any idea what was going on. He thought we were \\nsimply afraid, he didn\\'t know that they were killing us and that we had passed\\nbetween life and death. He came and got us and took us to the police precinct.\\nThere they looked us over. I was having trouble walking, my lungs hurt badly, \\nit was hard to breathe . . .\\n\\nMy supervisor\\'s name is Urshan Feyruzovich Mamedov. He\\'s the head of our \\nadministration. They took us there. When we were leaving, I saw a great number\\nof buses full of soldiers at the entrance to town. The buses were ordinary \\npassenger buses. There were very many soldiers. We left around eleven, right \\nafter eleven. If these people could stop what was happening they could save a \\ngreat many lives . . . Because the crowd was moving on, toward the school, and\\nwhat was going on there . . . I think everyone know not only in Sumgait, not \\nonly in Yerevan. Because there they murdered them all one after the next, \\nwithout stopping. After us.\\n\\nI think 14 people died in Microdistrict No. 3, and 10 to 12 of them were from\\nBuildings 4, 5, and 6. In our building one person died, and one old woman died\\nfrom Building 16, that\\'s the building in front of ours. There young \\nAzerbaijani men stopped the mob and wouldn\\'t let it into their building. \\nIncidentally, when we were at the neighbors\\', Marina called our relatives\\nto warn them, so they would all know what was happening. I called a aunt in \\nMicrodistrict No. 5. They have three neighbors who are Armenians. I said, \"Run\\nquickly, I can\\'t explain what\\'s going on; hide, do what you can, just stay\\nalive. Hide at Azerbaijanis\\', ones who won\\'t give you away.\" At that moment \\nthree people came in, policemen. I think they were Azerbaijanis. I was in such\\nawful condition, my face was completely distorted my lips were puffed up, \\nthere was blood, my eye was swollen, no one thought I would ever see anything \\nout of that eye again . . . my forehead was badly cut, and one-half of my face\\nwas pushed out forward. No one would have thought that I would survive, get my\\nnormal appearance back, and be able to grasp anything at all. I started to \\nscream at those people, why did you come, who sent you here, no one wants you \\nhere, haven\\'t you killed people people yet, what are you doing here? One of \\nthe soldiers said, \"Don\\'t scream at us. We\\'re Muslims, but we\\'re not from the \\nSumgait police. They called in from Daghestan.\" So at that point the \\nDaghestan police were there.\\n\\nWhen we got to the police precinct there were an awful lot of police there,\\nthere were soldiers, police with dogs, ambulances, firemen . . . I don\\'t know,\\nmaybe they were waiting for people to bring them the goners and the seriously \\ninjured to treat them there in the police precinct. I don\\'t know what they \\nwere there for. There were also doctors from Baku there. They examined Lyuda \\nand me and said, \"These women need to go to the Maternity Home, but we don\\'t \\nknow what to do with the rest.\"\\n\\nSo they took us, and I lost contact with my parents, my boss, everyone. My \\nboss said, \"Don\\'t worry, I\\'ll find you, no matter where you are, no matter\\nwhat happens.\" We went to the hospital. There we were examined by a department\\nhead from the Sumgait Maternity Home, Pashayeva, I think her name was. She \\nexamined us. The ambulance was from Baku; I figured out that the Sumgait \\nambulances hadn\\'t done anything, they didn\\'t respond to any calls. People \\ncalled and neither the police nor the ambulances showed any sign of life.\\n\\nThat doctor looked me over and I could tell from her behavior that something\\nvery good had happened, for she became quite glad. I even thought to myself, \\n\"God, can it be that nothing all that bad is wrong?\" She looks me over and \\nsays, \"Now why are you suffering so? You don\\'t know what your people have been\\ndoing, your people did even worse things.\" And I think, great, I have to deal \\nwith her . . . And I felt so bad, I thought, why don\\'t I just die so as not to\\nhave to hear more stuff like this from people like her? Here I am in this \\ncondition and being told about something that our people did. I just didn\\'t \\nhave the energy to say, \"How could our people possibly be smart enough to \\nthink of something that yours haven\\'t already done?\" I stayed there. Then they\\nbrought in another woman, Ira B., she was married, and she was raped in her \\nown apartment, too. There were three of us, Ira, Lyuda, and 1. The next \\nmorning they took Lyuda and Ira away. They didn\\'t do anything to help us. This\\nwas in the old Maternity Home, in the combined block. They didn\\'t do anything \\nmore than examine me, that was it. I didn\\'t want any shots or tranquilizer, \\nnothing. What shots could have calmed me down? I didn\\'t even want to look at \\nthem.\\n\\nI lay in the ward. Either it just worked out that way or they did it on pur-\\npose, but I was alone. I was alone even though the wards were packed. That\\nsame evening a woman came by and asked me what was wrong with me, that my face\\nwas disfigured. She asked what had happened to me, and I said, \"Better to ask \\nyour brother what happened, there\\'s no point in asking me, your brother can \\nbetter explain what happened.\" She fell into a faint. All the doctors threw \\nthemselves at her, and the doctor categorically forbade anyone to come into my\\nward.\\n\\nThen people from work came to see me, my boss, his daughter; they brought me \\nclothing, because I was literally naked. The only thing I had on was a dress, \\nbut the woman who gave it to me was very short, and the dress was way up \\nabove my knees, and the woman orderly said, \"I can\\'t believe you put on such a\\nshort dress, who are you showing off your legs to here?\" I went back to my \\nward thinking, just one more thing from something. People from work came and \\nbrought me something in a sack, apples, I think, three or four pounds, but I \\ncouldn\\'t take them. I had become so weak that it was just embarrassing. I said\\nthat I couldn\\'t take the apples, and really didn\\'t have any appetite. No one \\nhad to bring me anything. Some woman took the sack . . . And, oh yes! . . . \\nThen I heard that the head doctor tell a nurse that my medical history should \\nbe hidden or torn up completely so that no one would know that I was an \\nArmenian, maybe they wouldn\\'t figure it out from looking at me. So they must \\nhave been thinking that there would be some kind of attack, that something \\nelse would happen. That it would be worse. Or, perhaps, someone was outside on\\nthe street, I don\\'t know. In any case, I didn\\'t sleep a wink that night.\\n\\nThe next morning they picked me up, a whole police detail, put me in a bus, \\nand off we went. I didn\\'t even know where they were taking me. They took me to\\nthe club where the troops were, the very one I was in that ill-fated evening.\\nI got off the bus. Near the City Party Committee there were a great many \\ntroops, tanks, armored personnel carriers; the whole scene was terrible. I saw \\na few people I knew there, and that calmed me a little. I had already thought \\nthat I was the only one left. So there were five or six of us left in Sumgait \\nafter that night. I still didn\\'t know what happened to my parents, they didn\\'t \\ncome to see me in the hospital, and my boss told me that everything was fine. \\nI didn\\'t know whether to believe him or not. Maybe he was just trying to calm \\nme down, maybe something happened on the way. Then I went to the club and saw \\na lot of people I knew. They all knew one another, they were all kissing each \\nother and asking, \"What happened, what went on?\" Two days later they came to \\nsee me from work. They were there all the time. Each day they came, showed \\ninterest, and were constantly bringing me money. They did everything they \\ncould. Of course I\\'m most thankful to my boss, the only one of my colleagues \\nwho didn\\'t lose his presence of mind and who didn\\'t change his opinions, \\nneither before, nor after, nor in the heat of the moment, no matter what \\nhappened. He constantly took an interest. A sincere interest, from the heart \\n. . . Then, about two days later, the secretary of the Party Committee came, \\nnot from our Party organization, but from the First Trust, which ours is part \\nof, Comrade Kerimov, a very important figure in our town. He made arrangements\\nwith the emergency medical personnel to take me away, because if I sat down by\\nmyself I couldn\\'t get up or lie down again. There was something wrong with my\\nlungs, it was hard to breathe. They examined me there several times, there I \\nlay were several doctors, they all thought that . . . that it must just be \\nfrom all the blows, I don\\'t know. They didn\\'t diagnose anything in particular.\\nWhen I was in the Maternity Home I even asked . . . I made it a point of \\ninsisting that they take me to the trauma section because I felt so awful. \\nThere was no way something inside wasn\\'t broken, my ribs . . . Well they took \\nme there and took x-rays and said that everything was fine. There were \\nemergency medical workers on duty in the club. The mother of one of Marina\\'s \\nfriends was there. She was the head doctor at the Sumgait Children\\'s Clinic. \\nThey had every kind of antifever agent in the world, which was exactly what I\\nneeded at that moment, I thought. I said that I was having great difficulty\\nbreathing, I couldn\\'t seem to get enough air, something was wrong with me.\\nThey put tight bandages around my chest and waist. Later I overheard some\\npeople saying that I had been cut all over. I think they just saw me being all\\nbandaged up and decided that my breasts and face had been cut . . . But I\\nwasn\\'t cut.\\n\\nThey took us to the Khimik boarding house. We lived there a long time. Soon \\nappeared representatives . . . They were agitating. At first people would not \\ntalk to them, and drove them off. One of the Armenian women shouted, \"We \\ndemand that Seidov come!\" The response was, \"It\\'s Seidov who sent us.\" Seidov \\nis the Chairman of the Azerbaijani Council of Ministers. The woman said, \\n\"We\\'ll only see Seidov\\'s daughter, have her come here, we\\'ll do the same \\nthings to her that they did to our daughters, and then we\\'ll deal with you \\nagitators.\" And so on. More of them said, \"Have Seidov himself come.\" This \\nwent on day in, day out. The agitators kept coming and coming, this drove us \\nout of our wits. Then people gradually started departing for Yerevan because \\nthey realized it was senseless to stay. Everything got on our nerves: The \\nsmell, the small children. There were children at the SK club, children who \\nhad literally just come out of the Maternity Home. What were they doing in a \\nclub that didn\\'t even have running water all the time? At first we had to pay \\nto eat there. They even overcharged us, as it turned out. On the second day \\nsomeone told us that they would bring us food for free. The children were ill.\\nEverything stank there. Well imagine about 3,000 people in a small movie \\ntheater with seating for no more than 500. You couldn\\'t sit or lie down, it \\nwas impossible to even move. The stench was awful. Even the smallest infants \\ntook ill overnight there. I heard that they were arriving seriously ill in \\nYerevan, the infants. They have to be washed, they have to be bathed, not to \\nmention that we, the adults, were ill and needed care. People were fainting \\nright and left. I just don\\'t know, everyone was crying, everyone . . . Only \\nthe young people, the men, somehow managed to keep it together. But the women \\nwere in a constant state of panic. It seemed to everyone that they would come \\nany minute and kill and stab. It seemed clear that we had been gathered \\ntogether purposely, like during the war, so that they could burn the movie \\ntheater and there wouldn\\'t be a single Armenian left. Then people went up to \\nthe attic. I didn\\'t see them, I only heard them, because I was lying down and \\ncouldn\\'t get up. I lay right on the stage, we had some room there. Apparently \\nthey caught two people with either oil or gas. I think they wanted to burn the\\ntheater. Maybe someone saw them, I didn\\'t. I was in no condition to open my \\neyes.\\n\\nEveryone was suspicious of everyone else. They would ask, \"Aren\\'t you an \\nAzerbaijani? I think I saw you somewhere, I think you\\'re an Azerbaijani.\" They\\nled out all the men and started letting them back in by checking their\\npassports, relatives might be covering for each other. Half of the people did\\nnot have any documents. There were people who had run out of their homes in \\nnothing but a pair of pants and slippers, or wearing just a shirt, not like\\nthey should have, with their IDs.\\n\\nSo on the 28th, on Sunday, I think, the police did nothing to help us. On\\nMonday everything resumed where it had left off on Block 41A. They didn\\'t \\nspare a soul there: not children, not pregnant women, nobody. They killed,\\nthey burned, they hacked with axes, just everything possible. They murdered \\nthe Melkumian family whom I knew, my mother worked with them. Their daughter-\\nin-law went to school with my older sister. They were brutally murdered. Only \\nthe two daughters-in-law survived. By a miracle one was able to save herself, \\nshe ran away, the neighbors wouldn\\'t take her in, so she ran about the \\nbuilding until she found refuge. She was pregnant and had two small children. \\nThis all continued on Monday in Block 41A, on the 29th, when the troops were \\nalready in the city.\\n\\nThey murdered people, they overturned automobiles, and they burned entire \\nfamilies. They say they didn\\'t even know for sure if the people were Armenians\\nor not. I heard that the Lezgins suffered, too. I\\'m not sure myself, I didn\\'t \\nsee any Lezgins who had been injured. They burned cars so it\\'s very difficult \\nnow to say exactly who died and who didn\\'t. It was very difficult to identify \\nthe corpses, or rather, what remained of the corpses after they were doused in\\ngasoline and burned . . . it\\'s all very hard to imagine, of course I heard \\nthat many people disappeared without a trace, from the BTZ plant two people, \\nincluding a woman who worked the night shift, Aunt Razmella, who also lived in\\nMicrodistrict 3.\\n\\nThey were stopping buses between Baku and Sumgait. In the evening people who \\nhad been visiting Baku were returning to Sumgait, and people from Baku were \\ngoing home from Sumgait, and there were students, too. They were simply \\nsavagely murdered. They were stopping the buses, the drivers immediately did \\nwhat they were told because there was just no other way to deal with that \\nhoard of brutally minded people. They stopped the buses, dragged the Armenians\\nout and killed them on the spot. I didn\\'t see it myself, but I heard that they\\nput them all in a pile so as to burn them. Later it was hard to discern from \\nthe corpses, well you can\\'t call them corpses, you had to figure out from the \\nashes who it was. l heard that two fellows saved two women, one a student, Ira\\nG., if I\\'m not mistaken. She was in the hospital a long time after that, and \\nshe still can\\'t figure out who saved her. She was also brutally raped and \\nbeaten and thrown onto a pile of corpses. The fellow pulled her out of that \\nwhole pile of corpses, put his coat on her, took her into his arms, and \\ncarried her to the city. I still can\\'t imagine how he managed to do that.\\n\\nI heard that from Engels Grigorian. He knows her, apparently. Well a lot of \\npeople went to that hospital anyway. She was in the hospital and singing a \\nsong in Armenian, and they wrote the words down, and, I think he still has \\nthat piece of paper, because he says that a lot of people now have that song, \\nthe one she sang in the hospital where she lay in such bad shape. They \\ncouldn\\'t find the guy who saved her. He left her in someone\\'s apartment and\\ncalled the ambulance, she was in such awful shape that, probably, like me,\\nshe couldn\\'t remember anyone\\'s face.\\n\\nI think that I knew one of the people who broke into our house, maybe I had \\ntalked with him once. But I received so many blows everything was just knocked\\nout of my head. I can\\'t remember to this day who he was. Then, it seems, I saw\\nthe Secretary of the Directorate\\'s Party organization, where Marina works. She\\ngoes to school and works, she goes to night school at AZI, and works by day at\\nthe Khimzashchita Construction and Installation Administration. I\\'m the \\nSecretary of the Komsomol organization at our administration and often met \\nwith the secretaries of Party and Komsomol organizations. We had joint \\nmeetings. I know them all, I\\'ve even talked with them, and he, I know, is from\\nArmenia. An Azerbaijani, but from Armenia. It became obvious that many of \\nthose people were Azerbaijanis born in Armenia.\\n\\nThey took me to various police stations, to the police precinct, and to the\\nProcuracy, because the USSR Procuracy got involved in the case, and I iden-\\ntified the photographs of people who I could more or less recognize. They\\nshowed me the people who were in our apartment, they\\'re working on our\\ncase, but I can\\'t even recognize them, although it was proved that they were\\nthe ones, they\\'re processing it somehow. They tell me that they know that\\nsomeone held me by the arm and someone else held me by the leg when they were \\ndragging me. There was someone else in our apartment who did not even touch \\nme, he just stole a blanket and an earring or something like that. All these \\npeople, all of them, as much as I\\'ve heard about them and seen them, they were\\nall from Kafan.\\n\\nThe Secretary of the Party organization is named Najaf, Najaf Rzayev. He was \\nthere when everything started. It must have been him because I didn\\'t \\nrecognize anyone else in the crowd whom I knew besides him. All the more since\\nI told him, \"Listen, you do something, because you know me.\" He turned away \\nand went toward the bedroom, where Marina was. Well you couldn\\'t see Marina \\nanyway. There was such a noisy confusion of people that you couldn\\'t make out \\nanyone. All of it flew right out of my head, and then gradually I became \\nmyself again, at the City Party Committee . . . There were military people \\nthere. I told them what went on, and they wrote it all down. I told them his \\nname. On March 8 the Secretary of our First Trust Party organization, the one \\nwe\\'re part of, came to see us, his name is Najaf Rzayev. I tell Mamma, \"If\\nhe\\'s here despite the fact that I gave his name, it means that either his \\nalibi has been confirmed or, probably, that they think I\\'m crazy, not \\nresponsible for my words.\" He said, \"What did they do to you, how awful, \\nmyself, I hid an Armenian family.\" Then after some time goes by he comes back \\nagain and says something entirely different: \"I wasn\\'t at home, my family and \\nI went to Baku.\" I said, \"Marina, what is he saying? He said something totally\\ndifferent before.\" After that I didn\\'t go to see our Procurator, our case is \\nbeing handled by a procurator from Voronezh, Fedorov by name. Fedorov told me \\nthat Rzayev\\'s case had just gotten to him, and there were so names involved. \\nWhat are they doing with Rzayev?\\nDid he prove his alibi or not? They just think that since I was hit in the \\nhead I can\\'t say anything for sure, whether it was him or not. It will be an \\ninsult if he was in our apartment and doesn\\'t have to pay for it, but at the \\nsame time\\n\\nI\\'m afraid to say I\\'m a hundred percent sure that it was he. Because no mat-\\nter who I name, they tell me, no, you\\'re wrong, he didn\\'t do that, that one\\nwasn\\'t there. All the faces have gotten mixed up in my mind. Who did what\\nexactly I can\\'t say.                                                     \\n\\nWhen they took me outside there was a whole crowd there, but I didn\\'t see it, \\nbecause I had my eyes closed all the time. It seemed to me that I always got\\nit because of my eyes, people were always hassling me, for some reason it \\nalways seemed to me that my eyes are responsible. When they were beating my \\nface I thought they were trying to put my eyes out. So I had my eyes closed, \\nthey took me outside and started to beat me. A young guy, 22, held my arms, he\\nworks at the BTZ plant. And right nearby, across the road from us, Block 41, \\nis where all this was going on. Right across the road from us. The BTZ \\ndormitory is over there, that\\'s where he lives. Now he\\'s in custody, they even\\nhave proved, as far as I know, that it was he who killed Shurik Gambarian, the\\nclarinet player from the third entryway of our building. One person in our \\nbuilding was killed, it was that man.\\n\\nA guy comes by who shared a room with the guy who was holding me. He saw that\\nhe was holding me by the arms and that he was beating me, but he didn\\'t come \\nover, he just looked and then went into the dormitory. A while after it was \\nall over, people started making announcements in town saying that \\ninvestigators had been summoned. That guy went and told them everything. Now \\nthey\\'ve caught him, everything\\'s been proved. Now, evidently, they\\'ve been\\nbeating him, I don\\'t know what they\\'re doing with them over there, but he \\nhimself said that he was working the night shift at the plant. Some young guy \\ncame to the plant and said, \"Everyone who wants to kill Armenians come to the \\nbus station on Saturday at ten.\" That was it. He said, the ones who wanted to,\\nwent. This was at the BTZ plant, during the night shift, probably, late Friday\\nnight. It was at night, they were at the sauna together. And he said, what do \\nyou mean, do you understand what you are saying? The others were silent, \\nprobably, in their hearts they were thinking, I\\'m going to go. But they didn\\'t\\nsay anything to one another. He said that he thought it important to to go, \\nbecause he had heard a lot about what had happened in Kafan, that they had \\nkilled their Azerbaijani sisters, their mothers, burned villages, and all of \\nthat. That guy was also born in Kafan. That is certain. And Marina says that \\nthe Secretary of the Party organization is from Armenia, too.                                                             from\\n\\nI\\'ve participated in the investigation a couple of times. I\\'m satisfied with\\nthem thus far. They summoned us and asked about what happened, and every word \\nI said was recorded. I met some guy there . . . By the way, he was an \\nArmenian. I said that he was in our apartment, but what he did, I don\\'t know. \\nHis last name was Grigorian, Eduard Grigorian. He s from Sumgait, from \\nMicrodistrict 1. He was sentenced I think, to five years, not his first time. \\nHis mother is Russian. I met with him at the KGB in Baku, at the Azerbaijani \\nKGB. They took us there and showed me photographs. There were so many \\nphotographs, I think they even photographed those people who were caught at \\ncurfew, and I\\'ve got them all confused. I say, the face was about like this, \\nthe guy in the white coat with the red clasps. But he could take that coat off\\nand burn it somewhere, and it would be like looking for a needle in a \\nhaystack. Well. This guy, Grigorian, I said, he was in our apartment, but he \\nis so light-complected that he looks like a Lezgin. I don\\'t know what he did, \\nI can\\'t remember. Maybe he beat me or raped me. But he was in our apartment. \\nAt the KGB he started asking me, pleading with me, there\\'s no need for this, \\nall this stuff, look me in the eyes, you\\'re like a sister to me. I took a look\\nat him and thought, \"My God, Heaven forbid that I should have a brother like \\nyou.\" But they were satisfied with my responses, because I said everything \\nwithout great certainty. I was there with Mamma. Then Lyuda came in, but when \\nshe came in she got sick immediately. She wanted to kill him, she crawled over\\nthe table at him. She recognized him. When she came to, Lyuda was lying on the\\nbalcony, the mob threw her there and all of them ran into the bedroom. We had \\nall kinds of boxes with dishes in them, the dowries for all three sisters. \\nThey stole everything in the apartment, leaving only small things. At that \\nmoment Lyuda came to and started remembering everything. Well, seeing the \\nfaces, hearing the voices . . . Two people were saying they could burn the \\napartment. Another says, why burn the apartment when I\\'ve got three kids and \\nno place to live. So this guy was in temporary housing, he didn\\'t have \\nanywhere to live, he was from Sumgait. They were sure that they would get the \\napartment. Besides, the neighbors were Azerbaijani. Why should they burn the \\napartment, they might burn Azerbaijanis. That\\'s what they said. How did they \\nknow there were Azerbaijanis there, if they just picked a place, thinking that\\nArmenians lived there? We have a list of the residents for our part of the \\nbuilding, our name is in there, but how could they know that Azerbaijanis \\nlived on the other side of the wall from us? So they didn\\'t set fire to our \\napartment.\\n\\nI don\\'t know, I was in such bad shape that if all of it had come to a halt \\nwhen I was outside, if someone had asked me what was happening, I would\\nhave said that a civil war was going on. Well, maybe not civil . . . but\\nprobably civil, because when they were beating me I opened my eyes and saw\\nthat all the neighbors were standing on their balconies and watching, like at\\na free horror film. So a civil war was going on, and only the Armenians were\\nbeing fought. If it were a world war or something like that, they would have\\nbeen fighting everyone. But they only fought us. Then I met some women from \\nour building, some Azerbaijanis. They are crying, they tell me, \"Karina, we \\nsaw all of it, how could it happen?\" They\\'re asking me! Well I just don\\'t know\\nwhat to call it if a normal girl can stand there and watch what happened to \\nme. I think that if it were the other way around either I wouldn\\'t have been \\nable to take it, or I would have tried to avert it, like that one Azerbaijani \\nwoman did in front of our building. A woman lives there, an awful, dissipated \\nwoman, if you can call her a woman, the dissipated life she leads. Two \\nArmenian families live there, in her part of the building. She came out on the\\nbalcony and saw what was happening to me and started to scream and curse. She \\ncame down to the entryway and said, \"You\\'ll come in this entryway over my dead\\nbody.\" So not one of them took it in his head to go in that entryway. Some \\nfolks were saying that those people were so out of control that they didn\\'t \\neven know what they were doing. I don\\'t think that\\'s true. They knew very well\\nwhat they were doing if they didn\\'t even lift a hand against that woman. They \\ncouldn\\'t have cared less about her, but the fact that she was an Azerbaijani \\nstopped them.\\n\\nThey were just beasts, they had smoked so much. When they came to our place \\nthey were all chewing something. I noticed: Everyone who came into the \\napartment was chewing something. I think, my God, maybe I just think that? \\nMaybe I\\'m losing my mind? But no, they\\'re all chewing something. Maybe it is \\nsome kind of drug, it must be, because . . . At first glance they all seemed \\nto be such normal people, young, clean-shaven, looking exactly as if they had \\ncome to some sort of celebration. But they were shouting something. They\\ndidn\\'t talk, they shouted, as though there were deaf people there. They \\nscreamed and screamed: \"Yeah, killing, killing, we\\'re killing the Armenians!\" \\nOnly they didn\\'t shout \"kill,\" they shouted \"gurun ermianlary.\" Gurun \\nliterally means \"kill,\" or \"destroy.\"\\n\\nThat\\'s how it was! I\\'ll continue. We hid in a captain\\'s apartment, he\\'s an\\nAzerbaijani, his wife is a Tatar. We were sitting in their apartment, their \\nkids were out in the yard. Their kids knew a whole lot. This was in our part \\nof the building, on the third floor. When Mamma came to and couldn\\'t find\\nLyuda she took Papa\\'s hand, this was while the looters were stealing things,\\nbut they didn\\'t pay attention because they were stealing things. Apparently\\nthey had already ceased killing and switched to stealing. Mamma found the\\ncourage to . . .\\n\\nA boy said to my mother \"Where\\'s the gold?\" Mamma said he must have been 12 \\nto 14 years old. He even looked Russian, he was so fair-skinned. But the \\nAzerbaijanis from Armenia are fair-skinned. I noticed they were all on the \\nfair side. He shouted, they were all smashing things, and he asks Mamma where \\nthe gold is. We kept our gold in the wardrobe with our important papers. In a \\nlittle black bag, we kept everything in there. Mamma doesn\\'t really like to \\nwear gold. She probably never even wore those things from the time they were \\nbought for her. They took everything that was lying on the cheval glass. Mamma\\nthinks that the gold saved us. Because they threw themselves at the gold, and \\nMamma grabbed Papa, who was trying to breathe. They had closed his mouth, \\nbound his hands, and put a pillow and a chair on his face . . . They had \\nshoved something into his mouth so he would suffocate. Mamma grabbed him and \\ntore all that stuff off . . . He had something in his mouth, he was having \\ntrouble breathing, his nose was filled with blood. Mamma grabbed him and \\nstarted running from the fifth down to the first floor because no one wanted \\nto open their doors to them. Mamma said that by accident, completely by \\naccident that person opened his door, he was sleeping, and said, half-awake, \\n\"What\\'s happened?\" He sees that they are bloody. Mamma said, \"At least go and \\nfind out what\\'s happening to my daughters, even if they\\'ve burned them or \\nmurdered them, at least bring the corpses.\" He went looking for us. At that \\nmoment Lyuda was under the bed. She says that after they left it seemed that \\nsomeone was calling her name. When he quietly called her she couldn\\'t get out \\nfrom under the bed. She wanted to get out and was calling softly. She thought \\nshe was shouting, but in fact she was either silent or was only talking to \\nherself, it just seemed to her that she was shouting. When she got out from \\nunder the bed everyone was gone. And again . . . She thought that she had lost\\nher mind. I\\'ll never leave here, never! To hell with it! It just seems that \\nway to me, I\\'ll come to eventually. But then, when everything had settled \\ndown, stopped, that mall brought Lyuda down, and Igor carried me in from\\noutside. Or first I was brought in, then Lyuda, I don\\'t remember what order it\\nhappened in.\\n\\nAnd Mamma said, \"Listen, they\\'re all running around down there, shouting \\nsomething or other, and running toward the other building.\" It had more or \\nless calmed down where we were. Who\\'s dead, who\\'s alive, we don\\'t know. I \\ntried to call my girlfriend. I had basically come to. Mamma says, \"Listen;\\nlet\\'s go upstairs, at least get a mattress or something. We don\\'t know how \\nlong we\\'ll be here. Maybe they didn\\'t burn everything.\" I don\\'t get it, all\\nwomen have that feeling, they want to get something from their homes, maybe \\nnot everything was taken? I tell Mamma, \"Mamma, what do you need any of that \\nfor? To hell with it! We\\'re alive, forget the rest of it, all of it!\" She\\nsays, \"No, let\\'s go get at least something. Maybe we\\'ll leave here, spend the \\nnight at someone else\\'s.\" Mamma went upstairs, and their little boy, their son\\nAlik, was standing on the lookout. lIe was standing there to see if they were \\ncoming. They only managed to run up there and grab something one time. He \\nshouts, \"Come back, they\\'re coming!\" They didn\\'t have enough time to get a \\nlot, mattresses from one apartment, a blanket from another . . . Mamma got my \\nknitting . . . Someone managed to grab our old things, the ones we never wore,\\nout of the hall . . . Someone took Father\\'s old coveralls. The neighbor, his \\nwife, Mamma and Papa . . . Marina went with them. I was in no condition to \\nleave. Neither was Lyuda. We just sat. They ran out and we closed the door and\\njust then we hear that the mob is on its way toward our place upstairs, \\nthey\\'re dragging something again. They were going toward the other building, \\nmaybe over by the school, or . . . There was an unfinished building over\\nthere, people said they were going toward the basement or the unfinished \\nbuilding, they could gradually carry everything over there. Then things more \\nor less calmed down. I tried to call my boss.\\n\\nLater there was more noise. We were on the third floor, in a one-bedroom\\napartment, and a woman lives in the one-bedroom place on the second floor,\\nAsya Dallakian. She\\'s an old woman, retired. She wasn\\'t at home, at that\\ntime she was usually in the country, she has a married daughter there, and\\nher grandson is in the army. She is only very rarely in town; she gets her\\nretirement money and the apartment is essentially vacant. They started\\npounding on her door and broke it down. She had two or three beds in there, \\nsomething like that, she\\'s a 60-to 70-year-old woman who really does not even \\nlive there. Probably she had some pots, a couple of metal bed frames and \\nmattresses, and a television. When her grandson came she bought a television. \\nThey started wrecking everything. I started getting sick again. I think, \"My \\nGod, what is going on around here? When will this end?\" We turned off the \\nlights and sat. As it turns out the people who weren\\'t afraid, the ones who \\nknew what was going on, knew not to turn off the lights. We didn\\'t know, but \\nthey didn\\'t come to where we were all the same. They all knew very well that \\nhe was a captain. He went out and closed the door, and we sat in his \\napartment. His last name was Kasumov. He\\'s an exserviceman, retired, works up \\nat the fire station at some plant or other. He went out and stood at his door.\\nThey tell him, \"Comrade Captain, don\\'t worry, we won\\'t harm you, you\\'re one of\\nus.\" He went upstairs, and they say, \"Aren\\'t you taking anything from this \\napartment?\" He says, \"I don\\'t need anything.\" And the women who were standing \\nin the yard . . . we have a basement, full of water . . . the women who were \\nstanding in the yard saw. Those guys, they left everything they stole on the \\nfirst floor and ran upstairs again. The women threw everything they had time \\nto into the basement, to save our property. Some things were left: dirty \\npillows, two or three other things and a rug. A guy came downstairs, really \\nmad, and he says, \"Where\\'s the rug? I just put it right here!\" They tell him, \\n\"Some guy came and took it and went off toward the school.\" He ran off in that\\ndirection.\\n\\nOh! I forgot the most important point. When Igor picked me up in his arms, \\nthere were women standing there who saw everything that was going on. They \\njust didn\\'t tell me about it for a long time. The wife of that military man, \\nshe didn\\'t want to kill my spirit, I was already dead enough. Later she told \\nme, that after they murdered Uncle Shurik in the third entryway one of them, \\nthe ringleader, apparently a young man, said, \"Where\\'s the girl who was here?\"\\nAnd he became furious. The woman tells him, \"She came to . . . \" She didn\\'t\\nknow what to say: Think something up? Someone carried her off? Then they would\\ncomb the whole house and find me and our whole family. So the woman says, \"She\\ncame to and went to the basement.\" Now, our basement is full of water. So the \\nwhole mob dashes off to the basement to look for me or my corpse. They took \\nflashlights; they were up to their waists in water, water which had been \\nstanding there for years, and soot, and fuel oil. They climbed down in there \\nto get me. Then one of them said, \"There\\'s so much water down there, she \\nprobably walked and walked and then passed out and died. She met her death in \\nthe basement. That\\'s it, we can leave, no problem!\" I didn\\'t know that, and \\nwhen I was told, I felt worse. Two times worse. A lot worse! So they didn\\'t \\njust want to pound me flat, something more awful was awaiting me . . .\\n\\nAfter that we of course didn\\'t want to live in Sumgait any longer. We really \\ndidn\\'t want to go back to our apartment. When we moved, I went up there and \\nstarted to quiver and shake all over, because I started remembering it all. \\nAlthough the neighbors all sobbed, it was all . . . so cheap . . . The people \\nwho sat in their apartments and didn\\'t help us at a time like that. I think \\nthat they could have helped! I don\\'t think that they were obligated to, but \\nthey could have helped us! Because that one woman was able to stop that whole \\nbrutal crowd by herself. That means they could have, too. It would have been\\nenough foe one man or women to say, What do you think you\\'re doing?\" That\\'s \\nall! That would have done it. There were 60 apartments in our building. Not \\none person said it! When I was lying on the ground and all those people were \\nstanding on their balconies I didn\\'t hear anyone\\'s voice, no one said what are\\nyou doing, leave her alone . . . Mamma even told one of the neighbor women \\nthat if it had been an Azerbaijani woman in my place they would have dropped a\\nbomb if it would have killed even one Armenian. They would have stood up for \\none of their own. True, they say that our neighbor from the fourth entryway, \\nan old/ sick woman tried to stop the pogrom. The Azerbaijanis have a custom: \\nif a woman takes her scarf and throws it on the ground, the men are supposed \\nto stop immediately. The old woman from the fourth entryway did that, but they\\nstomped her scarf into the ground, pushed her off to the side, and said, \"If\\nyou want to go on living, you\\'ll disappear into your apartment.\" So she left.\\nThat trick didn\\'t work on them.\\n\\nEven the neighbors who helped us move told me, OK, fine, calm down, forget \\nthat it happened. I said I\\'d only forget it if I told them right then that it\\nhad happened to their daughter--and if that didn\\'t have any effect on them, \\nthen I would forget everything, too. Imagine that it happened to your sister. \\nAnd no one did anything.

Mr. Mark Holderman works down the hall from me, and can\\nbe reached for comment at (713) 483-1317, or via e-mail at\\nmholderm@jscprofs.nasa.gov.\\n\\nMark proposed this design, which he calls \"Geode\" (\"rough on the\\noutside, but a gem on the inside\") or the \"ET Strongback with\\nintegrated hab modules and centrifuge.\"  As you can see from file\\ngeodeA.gif, it uses a Space Shuttle External Tank (ET) in place of much\\nof the truss which is currently part of Space Station Freedom.  The\\nwhite track on the outside of the ET is used by the Station Remonte\\nManipulator System (SRMS) and by the Reaction Control System (RCS)\\npod.  This allows the RCS pod to move along the track so that thrusting\\ncan occur near the center of gravity (CG) of the Station as the mass\\nproperties of the Station change during assembly.\\n\\nThe inline module design allows the Shuttle to dock more easily because\\nit can approach closer to the Station\\'s CG and at a structurally strong\\npart of the Station.  In the current SSF design, docking forces are\\nlimited to 400 pounds, which seriously constrains the design of the\\ndocking system.\\n\\nThe ET would have a hatch installed pre-flight, with little additional\\nlaunch mass.  We\\'ve always had the ability to put an ET into orbit\\n(contrary to some rumors which have circulated here), but we\\'ve never\\nhad a reason to do it, while we have had some good reasons not to\\n(performance penalties, control, debris generation, and eventual\\nde-orbit and impact footprint).  Once on-orbit, we would vent the\\nresidual H2.  The ET insulation (SOFI) either a) erodes on-orbit from\\nimpact with atomic Oxygen, or b) stays where it is, and we deploy a\\nKevlar sheath around it to protect it and keep it from contaminating\\nthe local space environment.  Option b) has the advantage of providing\\nfurther micrometeor protection.  The ET is incredibly strong (remember,\\nit supports the whole stack during launch), and could serve as the\\nnucleus for a much more ambitious design as budget permits.\\n\\nThe white module at the end of ET contains a set of Control Moment\\nGyros to be used for attitude control, while the RCS will be used\\nfor gyro desaturation.  The module also contains a de-orbit system\\nwhich can be used at the end of the Station\\'s life to perform a\\ncontrolled de-orbit (so we don\\'t kill any more kangaroos, like we\\ndid with Skylab).\\n\\nThe centrifuge, which has the same volume as a hab module, could be\\nused for long-term studies of the effects of lunar or martian gravity\\non humans.  The centrifuge will be used as a momentum storage device\\nfor the whole attitude control system.

In April \\n1942, Hitler was preparing for the invasion of the Caucasus. A \\nnumber of Nazi Armenian leaders began submitting plans to German\\nofficials in spring and summer 1942. One of them was Souren Begzadian\\nPaikhar, son of a former ambassador of the Armenian Republic in Baku.\\nPaikhar wrote a letter to Hitler, asking for German support to his\\nArmenian national socialist movement Hossank and suggesting the\\ncreation of an Armenian SS formation in order \\n\\n\"to educate the youth of liberated Armenia according to the \\n spirit of the Nazi ideas.\"\\n\\nHe wanted to unite the Armenians of the already occupied territories\\nof the USSR in his movement and with them conquer historic Turkish\\nhomeland. Paikhar was confined to serving the Nazis in Goebbels\\nPropaganda ministry as a speaker for Armenian- and French-language\\nradio broadcastings.[1] The Armenian-language broadcastings were\\nproduced by yet another Nazi Armenian Viguen Chanth.[2]\\n\\n[1] Patrick von zur Muhlen (Muehlen), p. 106.\\n[2] Enno Meyer, A.

He played an important role in the\\nestablishment of the Armenian \\'legions\\' without assuming any \\nofficial position. His views were represented by his men in the\\nrespective organs. An interesting meeting took place between Dro\\nand Reichsfuehrer-SS Heinrich Himmler toward the end of 1942.\\nDro discussed matters of collaboration with Himmler and after\\na long conversation, asked if he could visit POW camp close to\\nBerlin. Himmler provided Dro with his private car.[1] \\n\\nA minor problem was that some of the Soviet nationals were not\\n\\'Aryans\\' but \\'subhumans\\' according to the official Nazi philosophy.\\nAs such, they were subject to German racism. However, Armenians\\nwere the least threatened and indeed most privileged. In August \\n1933, Armenians had been recognized as Aryans by the Bureau of\\nRacial Investigation in the Ministry for Domestic Affairs.\\n\\n[1] Meyer, Berkian, ibid., pp. 112-113.\\n\\nNeed I go on?\\n\\nSerdar Argic',\n  'I don\\'t think speed has been determined, since it has never run on Intel chips.\\nBut on the Amiga\\'s Motorola Chips, it was one of the fastest true \\'Ray Tracers\\'\\n\\nI don\\'t think Impulse would port it over and not take speed into consideration.\\n\\nIn terms of features, and learning curve...

In some parishes here in South Africa the only ones who receive communion are infants (i.e. children under\\n 7). In our parish it is expected that one will have been to Vespers and confessional prayers the evening before, and that one will have been fasting.

It is **very** difficult to \"identify\" who they are (this\\n*is why* the \"guerillas\" prefer to lose themselves in the general population \\nby dressing the same, acting the same, etc.).\\nI agree; but, because Lebanon was either unwilling or unable to stop these\\nattacks from its territory should Israel simply sit quietly and accept its\\nsituation? Israel asked the Lebanese government over and over to control\\nthis \"third party state\" within Lebanese territory and the attacks kept\\noccuring. At **what point** does Israel (or ANY state) have the right to do\\nsomething ITSELF to stop such attacks? Never?\\nIt is also the responsibility of *any* state to NOT ALLOW *any* outside\\nparty to use its territory for attacks on a neighboring state.

If not, are you saying that\\nAngola HAD to accept the situation, do NOTHING and absorb the attacks?\\nI refered above *at all times* to the Palestinian attacks on Israel from\\nLebanese soil, NOT to Lebanese attacks on Israel. \\n\\nOne hopes that a Lebanese government will be strong enough to patrol its \\nborder but there is NO reason to believe it will be any stronger. WHAT HAS \\nCHANGED is that the PLO was largely *driven out* of Lebanon (not by the \\nLebanese, not by Syria) and THAT is by far the most important making it \\nEASIER to control future Palestinian attacks from Lebanese soil. That\\n**change** was brought about by Israeli action; the PLO would *never*\\nhave been ejected by Lebanese, Arab state or UN actions. \\nI fully recognize that the Lebanese do NOT WANT to be \"used\" by EITHER side,\\nand have been (and continue to be).

(Which is now, by the way, blaming their rising\\ngun-crime rate on the U.S.  Strange that the border used to \"magically\"\\nkeep the guns out, but now isn\\'t.)\\n\\n\\n       The other side of the coin, of course, is that far \"illegal drugs\"\\nare purchases legally or stolen from people who purchase them legally. \\nI\\'ve still not been convinced that guns, a commodity which criminals\\nhave shown their perfectly willing to pay for from illegal sources\\n(stolen either from police, military, or civilian) we wouldn\\'t simply\\nsee South American sources from which drugs come start smuggling guns as\\nwell, since there\\'s a thriving gun manufacturing industry down there.\\n\\n\\n        And as was not pointed out in the study, but in critiques\\nof it, (two seperate articles by James Wright and David Kopel come\\nto mind) it was pointed out that the difference was *also* almost\\nentirely minority related.  That is, the gun crime rate skyrocketed\\nfor poor minorities (Blacks and Hispanics primarily) while when you\\ncompared the white majority they were virutally identical.\\n\\n        The problem with the NEJM study was they compared minority vs.\\nnon-minority percentages but failed to take into account the relative\\nconditions of those minorities.  That there was an eqaul percentage of\\nnomn-whites was about as far as they went.  They failed to take into\\naccount that the non-whites in either city were not living in the\\nsame conditions.\\n\\n        If the situation was entirely based on availability of guns,\\nthen we\\'d expect that the white rates, the two groups which are\\narguably fairly comparative in the two cities, would have a far\\nhigher rate in Seattle.  Yet the majority in Seattle is not only\\nnot significantly higher when the minorities are excluded, but slightly\\nlower.\\n\\n\\n\\n       The point is, of course, that many of the U.S. \"inner-city\"\\nproblems are not mirrored in Canada.  As such  if there is a condition\\nwhich is significantly different in Canada from the U.S., and violent\\ncrime is highly correlated to that area, suggesting that gun control\\nis the source of Canada\\'s low rate is highly questionable.  (As one\\nCanadian pointed out on talk.politics.guns, Canada\\'s major gun control\\nin 1978 did not result in either a reduction or a slowing of an increase\\nin violent crime rates, which have been rising steadily since.  Apparently\\nthey didn\\'t even mirror the U.S.s very large drop of violent crime in\\nthe early eighties.\\n\\n\\n       True only to a certain extent.  Take Washington D.C., where\\ngun control was instituted while it had crime problems true, but that\\ncrime proceeded to explode afterwards.  Similarly for New York.\\n\\n       The question is not simply a point in time where crime was high\\nor low.  Did the gun control significantly and positively impact\\nviolent crime.  Since it\\'s gone up in those areas, often faster than it\\nwas going up before, you can\\'t simply dismiss the high crime rate by\\nsaying gun control was caused by it.  Yes, gun control may be instituted\\nto deal with high crime.  But if the crime is not positively impacted, you\\ncan\\'t continually say that that crime rate was entirely a cause of\\nthat gun control, since much of that crime rate increased after gun control\\nwas implemented, just as happened in Canada.\\n\\n\\n       As would be expected if violent crime was generally independent\\nof gun control.\\n\\n\\n       Would this be the laws which made manufacturers liable for what\\nothers did with their guns, and suddenly the police found nobody would\\nsell to them?',\n  \"\\nShe hasn't.

One\\nof the most basic requirements of evolution is that members of a\\nspecies procreate, those who don\\'t have no purpose in that context.\\n\\n: \\n: |&gt; Another point is that if the offspring of each generation is to\\n: |&gt; survive, the participation of both parents is necessary - a family must\\n: |&gt; exist, since homosexuals do not reproduce, they cannot constitute a\\n: |&gt; family. Since the majority of humankind is part of a family,\\n: |&gt; homosexuality is an evolutionary abberation, contrary to nature if you\\n: |&gt; will.\\n: |&gt; \\n: \\n: Well if that is true, by your own arguements homosexuals would have \\n: vanished *years* ago due to non-procreation.  Also the parent from single\\n: parent families should put the babies out in the cold now, cos they must,\\n: by your arguement, die.\\n\\nBy your argument, homosexuality is genetically determined. As to your\\nsecond point, you prove again that you have no idea what context\\nmeans. I am talking about evolution, the preservation of the species,\\nthe fundamental premise of the whole process.\\n: \\n: |&gt; But it gets worse. Since the overwhelming majority of people actually\\n: |&gt; -prefer- a heterosexual relationship, homosexuality is a social\\n: |&gt; abberation as well. The homosexual eschews the biological imperative\\n: |&gt; to reproduce and then the social imperative to form and participate in\\n: |&gt; the most fundamental social element, the family. But wait, there\\'s\\n: |&gt; more.\\n: |&gt; \\n: \\n: Read the above.  I expect you to have at least ten children by now, with\\n: the family growing.  These days sex is less to do with procreation (admittedly\\n: without it there would be no-one) but more to do with pleasure.  In pre-pill\\n: and pre-condom days, if you had sex there was the chance of producing children.\\n: These days is just ain\\'t true!  People can decide whether or not to have \\n: children and when.  Soon they will be able to choose it\\'s sex &c (but that\\'s \\n: another arguement...) so it\\'s more of a \"lifestyle\" decision.  Again by\\n: your arguement, since homosexuals can not (or choose not) to reproduce they must\\n: be akin to people who decide to have sex but not children.  Both are \\n: as \"unnatural\" as each other.\\n\\nYet another non-sequitur. Sex is an evolutionary function that exists\\nfor procreation, that it is also recreation is incidental. That\\nhomosexuals don\\'t procreate means that sex is -only- recreation and\\nnothing more; they serve no -evolutionary- purpose.\\n\\n: \\n: |&gt; Since homosexuals have come out the closet and have convinced some\\n: |&gt; policy makers that they have civil rights, they are now claiming that\\n: |&gt; their sexuality is a preference, a life-style, an orientation, a\\n: |&gt; choice that should be protected by law. Now if homosexuality is a mere\\n: |&gt; choice and if it is both contrary to nature and anti-social, then it\\n: |&gt; is a perverse choice; they have even less credibility than before they\\n: |&gt; became prominent. \\n: |&gt; \\n: \\n: People are people are people.  Who are you to tell anyone else how to live\\n: their life?  Are you god(tm)?  If so, fancy a date?\\n\\nHere\\'s pretty obvious dodge, do you really think you\\'ve said anything\\nor do you just feel obligated to respond to every statement? I am not\\ntelling anyone anything, I am demonstrating that there are arguments\\nagainst the practice of homosexuality (providing it\\'s a merely an\\nalternate lifestlye) that are not homophobic, that one can reasonably\\ncall it perverse in a context even a atheist can understand. I realize\\nof course that this comes dangerously close to establishing  a value,\\nand that atheists are compelled to object on that basis, but if you\\nare to be consistent, you have no case in this regard.\\n: \\n: |&gt; To characterize any opposition to homosexuality as homophobic is to\\n: |&gt; ignore some very compelling arguments against the legitimization of\\n: |&gt; the homosexual \"life-style\". But since the charge is only intended to\\n: |&gt; intimidate, it\\'s really just demogoguery and not to be taken\\n: |&gt; seriously. Fact is, Jim, there are far more persuasive arguments for\\n: |&gt; suppressing homosexuality than those given, but consider this a start.\\n: |&gt; \\n: \\n: Again crap.  All your arguments are based on outdated ideals.  Likewise the\\n: bible.  Would any honest Christian condemn the ten generations spawned by\\n: a \"bastard\" to eternal damnation?  Or someone who crushes his penis (either\\n: accidently or not..!).  Both are in Deuteronomy.\\n\\nI\\'m sure your comment pertains to something, but you\\'ve disguised it\\nso well I can\\'t see what. Where did I mention ideals, out-dated or\\notherwise? Your arguments are very reactionary; do you have anything\\nat all to contribute?\\n\\n: \\n: |&gt; As to why homosexuals should be excluded from participation in\\n: |&gt; scouting, the reasons are the same as those used to restrict them from\\n: |&gt; teaching; by their own logic, homosexuals are deviates, social and\\n: |&gt; biological. Since any adult is a role model for a child, it is\\n: |&gt; incumbent on the parent to ensure that the child be isolated from\\n: |&gt; those who would do the child harm. In this case, harm means primarily\\n: |&gt; social, though that could be extended easily enough.\\n: |&gt; \\n: |&gt; \\n: \\n: You show me *anyone* who has sex in a way that everyone would describe as\\n: normal, and will take of my hat (Puma baseball cap) to you.  \"One man\\'s meat\\n: is another man\\'s poison\"!\\n: \\n\\nWhat has this got to do with anything?

One of his best throwaway lines was to\\nremind us that all of us holders of carry permits there had been\\nchecked and certified clear of all crimes by the state; while the\\npeople in the Statehouse behind us only had to be certified clean of\\n\"election fraud\" to hold their jobs.\\n\\nNancy Snow and Amos Hamburger were busy handing out ID buttons and\\nsheets describing all the bills to be presented at the hearings, and\\ntelling people where to find their own representatives (and in too\\nmany cases, who they were).\\n\\nMike warned us that the committee was going to suspend its rules and\\ndiscuss a bill that hadn\\'t made it onto the official list.  It seems a\\ndelegation of students from Simon\\'s Rock of Bard College (alma mater\\nof Wayne Lo, who shot up the place with an SKS late last year) was\\nbeing bussed in to testify for a bill to ban all sales of firearms or\\nammo to anyone who is not a state resident.\\n\\nThe hearings were originally scheduled in the (large) Gardner\\nAuditorium at 10:30, but that had been pre-empted by the Governor\\'s\\nhearings on the Framingham Eight (women in prison for killing abusive\\nhusbands, and seeking release).  So we had until 1:30 to buttonhole\\nour representatives, after which we would be squashed into an\\ninadequate hearing room.\\n\\nOne of my representatives\\' staffers was somewhat offensively smarmy.\\nHe said, \"Oh, it must be gun hearings day again!  The gun lobby is\\nalways so organized every year.\"  I got a little pissed, and replied,\\n\"I\\'m not from the gun lobby -- I\\'m from your district.\"\\n\\nAt 12:30, your second reporter arrived in time to notice a\\ndemonstration going on in front of the statehouse (where the\\npro-gunners weren\\'t).  Randy Price from the TV News was there, in his\\nmirror reflective shades, talking to one of the anti-gun types, and\\nseveral Simon\\'s Rock anti-gun \"close-the-loophole\" protestors.\\n(Earlier, Randy had covered the GOAL rally.)\\n\\nThe room we had been assigned seated about 50.  Remember, there were\\nabout 160 gun owners there, plus another 20-30 students and teachers\\nfrom Bard.  One of us had already reserved a seat; the other never got\\ncloser than the atrium outside -- and there was a crowd behind HIM.  A\\ncop took up station at the entrance and prevented the rest of the\\ncrowd from coming in.  Soon after the debate started, a loudspeaker\\nwas set up outside in the hall for the benefit of everyone else.\\n\\nEveryone who was there (inside and outside) got to sign up on a sheet\\nsaying what their position was on which bills.  Most of us signed up\\nto \"support GOAL\\'s position\" on \"all bills.\"\\n\\nFirst, because of their time constraints, public officials got to\\ntestify.  And first up was the bill that nobody had seen (the students\\nhad some curfew, I guess).  \\n\\nCurrently, Massachusetts law allows a non-resident to purchase long\\nguns or ammo from a local dealer provided he complies with the laws of\\nhis own state.  Previously, the law was similar, but applied only to\\nnon-residents from states adjoining Massachusetts.  The Simon\\'s Rock\\nfolks called the current law a \"loophole\" and wanted it closed.\\n\\nTwo of their reps spoke about Wayne Lo and his \"SKS assault rifle.\"\\nThe second one, Hodgekiss, a co-sponsor, had done his homework so well\\nthat he kept confusing Montana (Wayne Lo\\'s home state) with Missouri,\\nand became belligerent when about five gun owners in the gallery\\ncorrected him after his second muff.  Carr, from Gloucester, claimed\\nthat the new bill would put the law back the way it was, but he was\\nlying: the new bill allows purchases by non-residents of adjoining\\nstates ONLY if they have licensing in their own state \"as strong as\"\\nthat in Massachusetts.  Since none of them do, that\\'s that.\\n\\nSome of the things these two said were really offensive.  \"In some of\\nthese other states, anyone can buy a gun as long as he\\'s breathing!\"\\n(Oooooo!)  \"We have some very, very good gun laws in Massachusetts; if\\nonly the other states would adopt the same type of laws, we wouldn\\'t\\nbe having this situation -- but they won\\'t.\"  (Naughty, naughty!)\\n\\nNext up was Boston city councilman Albert \"Dapper\" O\\'Neill.  He was\\nthere to testify pro-gun, but in some ways he was a liability.  He\\'s\\nreasonably elderly and tends to wander and repeat himself, plus he\\'s\\nalmost a caricature of a law-n-order politician.  He badmouthed the\\nACLU, said violent criminals should be executed, and that if he were\\njudge, he\\'d give arrestees their \"last rights\" (pun intended) on the\\nspot (at which many of the gun owners applauded, which bothered me.)\\nHe said that all the proposed gun restrictions were a step in the\\nright direction -- for the criminals.  He said this FOUR times :-(\\n\\nTwo of the bills under consideration would allow police to rescind a\\nCCW or FID, and confiscate all your guns, if someone had filed a\\nrestraining order against you.  (Note that the filing of a restraining\\norder requires no warrant, no hearing, no evidence, and no conviction\\n-- just an accusation.)  Senator Barrett of Reading testified in favor\\nof it, and patronized the pro-gunners there several times by saying,\\n\"I\\'m sure all the gun owners here will agree with me that we have to\\nget these weapons out of the hands of people that our courts have\\nconvicted.\"  I haven\\'t seen such a disgustingly disingenuous\\nperformance since Nixon whined that he wasn\\'t a crook.\\n\\nBarrett also spoke in favor of the bill making the FID card renewable\\nevery five years, instead of permanent as it is now.  The stated\\npurpose is to remove FID cards from those who have become ineligible.\\n\"Revenue has nothing to do with it.\"  (Yeah, right.)  Apparently, some\\ncongressmen think we\\'re stupid enough to swallow the argument that\\nit\\'s preferable to process 1.6 million renewals every cycle in the\\nvague hope of catching a recent felon than to simply take the goddamn\\ncard away from a criminal at conviction time.  As usual, hassle the\\nlaw-abiding instead of the crook.\\n\\nThe two co-chairs of the committee were Rep. Caron and Sen. Jujuga.\\nJujuga didn\\'t say much (he was a co-sponsor of both \"restraining\\norder\" bills) but Caron struck me as a sharp guy that wouldn\\'t let any\\nbad logic or lies on the part of either side to go unchallenged.  (He \\nwas a co-sponsor of one of the \"restraining order\" bills as well.)  One\\nof the younger reps on the committee (forgot his name) was\\nvociferously pro-gun, somewhat embarrassingly so.  His heart was in\\nthe right place, but his arguments seemed to be confined to, \"every\\nyear it\\'s the same damn thing, you come in here with this crap...\"\\nIt\\'s nice to have a friend on the committee, but he could have been\\nmore effective.\\n\\nAt about 3:00, it was clear that the hall-jam couldn\\'t continue.\\nSomeone came out of another meeting hall and yelled at the cop because\\nthe loudspeaker was disturbing their meeting, so the loudspeaker was\\ndisconnected.  So they found a bigger hall upstairs.  One of us had\\nto leave to catch his charter bus, and so missed the \"public\"\\ntestimony; the other got a seat this time.\\n\\nCaron began by talking about how he got his FID 16 years ago, left the\\nstate, and then returned without notifying them of his address change.\\nHe complained that the state record system was not up-to-date and that\\nhis PD back in his city of birth still thought he lived there.  Great\\nquote: \"If you purchase a gun today, it will not get into the state\\ncomputer system until 1999.\"  (This was also an argument he used\\nagainst the renewable FID card.)\\n\\nTestimony was heard from several \"battered women,\" one of whom had\\nbeen attacked by some guy in his 20\\'s who had an FID card because he\\ngot it when he was 15 or thereabouts.  They used a lot of emotion and\\nsaid how they were scared of these men.  A staffer of Attorney General\\nHarshbarger testified in favor of this anti-gun bill, saying how\\n50,000 restraining orders were granted last year, and how these women\\nneeded to be protected.  Caron noted that a restraining order was\\ngranted for 10 days, and then a hearing was held to determine whether\\nthe order would be extended to a year.  He asked whether she would be\\nsatisfied if the FID were revoked at the time of this hearing rather\\nthan after the initial issuance of the FID.  She gave some long\\nrambling circumlocution in response.\\n\\nThen testimony against the bill was heard.  Mike Yacino (who looks\\nsomething like Einstein) got up and made the point that restraining\\norders were issued on too little evidence, that judges like to issue\\nrestraining orders just to let things cool off no matter who they\\nthink is right (man or woman), and that the hearings for restraining\\norders are lightning sessions with little time to consider facts.\\nAtty. Karen McNutt spoke with him a few times during his testimony.\\n\\nOther pro-gunners got up to testify.  One said he had had to file a\\nrestraining order against a tenant to clear her out, and that she\\ncountered by filing one against him!  He noted that this would have\\nallowed the state to confiscate his guns if the new bill became law.\\nOne of the junior reps noted that \"this is America\" and we have to be\\ncertain that individual rights are respected.  Senator Jujuga\\nreiterated this, saying that \"people who abuse smaller people can go\\nto Hell as far as I care, but we have to be careful about equating\\nconviction with a restraining order.\"  (Point and match, Senator.)\\n\\nAnother pro-gunner got up and testified that he didn\\'t know his\\ncitizenship \"expired every 5 years,\" and that a driver\\'s license was a\\nprivilege, not a right like the right to keep and bear arms.\\n\\nA third got up and said the problem was with the criminal justice\\nsystem, and argued in favor of a death penalty bill and public\\nhangings.  Senator Jujuga said he had himself tried to get a death\\npenalty bill passed, and joking responded that he, too, favored public\\nhangings.  The speaker then responded, \"I\\'ll make you a deal.  You get\\nme the rope, and I\\'ll tie the noose.\"\\n\\nNext came public testimony on the Simon\\'s Rock bill.  A teacher\\ntestified that she had been the teacher of Wayne Lo, and that \"he\\nwouldn\\'t have been able to shoot people inside a building while he was\\noutside\" without his evil gun.  She said that the \"loophole\" should be\\nclosed to prevent something like this from \"ever happening again\".\\n\\nFour or five other kids testified in favor of this bill, one of\\nspilling tears for the good legislators.  One of the students actually\\nshot by Wayne Lo was also there.  Many of them had T shirts on,\\nsaying, \"As long as one person can buy a gun in anger, none of us are\\nsafe -- support gun control.\"  The committee was reluctant to grill or\\ncorrect the kids, except for Caron, who corrected one student who had\\nclaimed that anyone could apply for an FID.  \"Only residents can get\\nFID\\'s,\" he said.  (How much do you want to bet that this kid had no\\nidea he had been conned into testifying for a bill that would cut\\nout-of-staters completely off?)\\n\\nYacino and McNutt spoke again, this time noting that the bill as\\nwritten would affect both ammo AND ALL guns possessed by\\nout-of-staters.  Karen also noted that hunters in CT, NH, and VT could\\nbe put away for a year if they wandered across the MA boundary\\nsomewhere in the woods and got challenged by game wardens.  Yacino\\nunderscored the fact that Lo COULD have gotten an FID as a resident\\nstudent -- and, hell, even an CCW, as he had NO criminal or mental\\nrecord.\\n\\nOne junior rep was upset that it would take MA residents longer to buy\\na gun than out-of-staters, and thought it was \"elitist\".  Another\\n(Caron?) said that we need the protection of preventing non-residents\\nfrom buying without an FID because only two other states in the union\\nhad \"FID-type\" cards, so complying with all the laws of one\\'s home\\nstate was \"not enough.\"  One pro-gun speaker replied that this\\nresembled a mother watching her son in a marching band and exclaiming,\\n\"Everyone\\'s out of step but Johnny!\"\\n\\nAll the Bard College people were filing out as the pro-gun testimony\\nfor this bill was made, and thus only pro-gunners were around when the\\nother bills came under consideration.  The main bills remaining (and\\nGOAL\\'s position) were:\\n\\no  H.4375 and four others: Notify police chiefs so they can pull \\n   licenses when a holder is convicted (strongly supported)\\n\\no  H.1732: Require trigger locks on all handguns sold (opposed)\\n\\no  H.962: Require trigger locks on all loaded firearms (strongly\\n   opposed)\\n\\no  H.1350: Allow every municipality to enact their own gun laws \\n   (opposed)\\n\\no  H.1731: Fund bullet-proof vests for municipal police (supported)\\n\\no  S.1097: State Constitutional Amendment for the RKBA (supported)\\n\\no  Several on police discretion in the issuance of FID cards (opposed)\\n\\no  Several altering non-resident license conditions (supported)\\n\\no  H.1135: Ban damn near all guns everywhere in the state (guess!)\\n\\nSome of these took only 30 seconds to consider, as the remaining\\npro-gunners raised hands in unison either for or against them.\\n\\nMike Yacino noted that, besides the danger in screwing with a trigger\\nlock on a loaded gun, that bill would make it illegal for a licensee\\nto carry his concealed handgun unless it were locked.\\n\\nCaron blew right through H.1350 when he saw that we opposed it.\\nAgain, he brought up the state\\'s archaic records capability and said,\\n\"This would create hundreds of different licensing systems.\"\\n\\nThe session ran late -- since it was the last scheduled hearing, it\\ncould not be adjourned until everyone who wanted to had testified.

The function of this spoof chip is twofold:\\n    \\n\\t1) Transmit Channel\\n\\n\\t    The spoof chip XORs the 30 bit encrypted serial number with\\n\\t    a secondary keying variable.  This renders the serial number\\n\\t    unrecoverable with just the family key\\n\\n\\t2) Receive Channel\\n\\n\\t    The spoof chip XORs the incoming encrypted serial number\\n\\t    with a secondary keying variable (assuming integrity of the\\n\\t    law enforcement block is necessary for local operation -\\n\\t    checksums, sequence control, etc.).\\n\\nThis has the net result of hiding the serial number.  It is probable theere is\\na known plaintext pattern used as a filler in the block containing N (34 bits\\nas used in generating U, U1,U2) correctness of the law enforcement block\\ncan be determined with only the family key F.  Whereas, no one has proposed\\nFederal Agencies be denied F, and because they could recover it themselves,\\nThe correctness of the serial number can be tested by examining the pad bits\\nof N in E[N; F].\\n\\nThe one could selectively alter the law enforcement block as above, but the\\nmutilation could be detected.  A better approach would be to mutilate the\\nentire law enforcement block.  If it were done with a group encryption scheme\\nsuch as DES or (presumably) Skipjack, the chances the law enforcement block\\ncan be recovered are lessened.\\n\\nWhat do you want to bet the transmission protocol can be recognized and the\\nserial numbers decrypted in a target search?  When digital transmission\\nbecomes widely available, would there be a requirement that clipper protocol\\ntransmissions be refused when containing mutilated law enforcement blocks?\\n\\nOne way to avoid notice, would be to spoof protocol information of the block\\ncontaining M, as well as spoofing the law enforcement block.\\n\\nThe goal is to use a secure communications scheme, without redress to \\ndetection or key K interception (contained encrypted within the law\\nenforcement block).  The data stream is returned to its original state\\nfor use by the clipper chip (or system) if required, for proper operation.\\n\\nIt is somewhat improbable that the entire protocol will be contained within\\nthe clipper chip, yet likely that sequence of events will be tested for,\\nrequiring a valid law enforcement block to be received before accepting\\nand decrypting E(M; K);\\n\\nThe spoof chip could be implemented anywhere in the protocols, including\\non the resulting serial data stream.  Existing clipper products could\\nbe subborned.  After all, they are high security encryption systems right?\\n\\nSuper encipherment/encryption could allow the chip to be used without\\nredress to detection of the use of the chip, or disclosure of the serial\\nnumber.  Security must be adequate to deny the serial number, which should\\nnot be recoverable by other means.  One can see the use of cut outs for\\nprocurring clipper phones, or once the number of units is high enough,\\nstealing them.

These captured law enforcement blocks would be used as authenticators,\\nsuch as in a manually keyed encryption system.  Fending this off would require\\nescalation in examining the protocols and blocks in the transmission.\\n\\nThe M code stream  might be independently attacked based on knowledge of\\nclipper chip protocols as revealed plaintext.  This could be invalidated\\nby changing the temporal and or spatial relationship of the clipper M stream\\nand the actual transmitted stream, under the control of a secure key\\ngenerator synchronized between endpoints.\\n\\nThe useful life time of captured law enforcement blocks might be limited\\nbased on hostile forces using them as targets following transmission\\ninterception.

EDT\\n\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  The speech that \\nOctavius gave says more than anything I will be able to say today \\nabout why it's important to give all of our young people a chance to \\nget a work experience and to continue to learn, to merge the nature \\nof learning and work; why it's important to honor the efforts of \\npeople like Jerry Levin and Nancye Combs and Pat Irving and all of \\nthose who are here.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I want to thank the Secretaries of Labor and Education \\nand all the people who work with them for sponsoring this; and my \\ngood friend, Governor Wilder, for being here and for speaking; and \\nall of the business and local community leaders from the city and \\ncounty and state level from around America who are here. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     This has been a pretty fun day.  (Laughter.)  I loved \\nhearing the young people sing.  It was music to my ears because it is \\ntheir future that we are really struggling about.  (Applause.)  A \\nyear and a half ago I began the quest to seek the presidency because \\nI was concerned about their future.  Because I believe that our \\ncountry, which had always been a beacon of hope for the young, had \\ntoo little opportunity, was too divided among ourselves across lines \\nof income and race and region and other ways, without a vision to \\ntake us into the future.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I entered with the hope that together we could create \\nmore opportunity and insist on much more responsibility from all of \\nour people.  But in the process we might recreate the best of \\nAmerica's community, knowing that together we could always to more \\nthan we could individually and that we might secure our future.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     All of you here today are committed to that.  The 1,000 \\njobs that Jerry Levin has committed Time-Warner to is symbolic of the \\ncommitments made by many of the private sector people who are here, \\nand those who are around the country.  The work that Nancye Combs \\ndoes, and the successes of all the young people like those on this \\nstage, and especially the eloquent statement Octavius Jeffers -- all \\nthose things show that together we know what we need to do, and we're \\non the right track.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Last July when I was traveling across America's \\nheartland in my luxurious bus, I visited Seneca High School in \\nLouisville, Kentucky.  And there I met young people and business \\npeople who were participating in the Louisville Education and \\nEmployment Partnership.  I saw what Nancye Combs talked about today.  \\nI saw how the young people were making an extra effort to succeed \\nboth in school and at work.  I saw, as I have seen many times in my \\nown state, the principle illustrated that Octavius has talked about \\n-- that for millions of American young people it is really an \\nimpediment to both their learning and their ability to be good \\nworkers to draw a sharp dividing line between what is work and what \\nis learning.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     In the world in which we are living, the average young \\nperson will change the nature of work seven or eight times in a \\nlifetime.  We must learn to merge the work world and the learning \\nworld much better.  And we must determine that all of our young \\npeople see the opportunities that some of them have had showcased \\nhere today.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Whether you're in business or in government or in \\neducation, you know that we have a big job to do when it comes to \\nbuilding a future that really, honestly includes opportunity for all \\nof our people.  There are still a lot of people who say, well, things \\nare pretty good here in Washington and everything's fine; the best \\nthing we can do about this whole thing is nothing.  They all have \\njobs.  (Laughter.)  All the people who say that.  (Applause.)  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     They all have health insurance.  They all have a pretty \\ngood education.  And they all have a pretty secure knowledge that \\nthey'll be okay no matter what happens.  I say that not to be either \\npolitical or unduly critical, but to point out that one of the great \\nchallenges of this age for every advanced nation -- everyone -- is to \\nfully develop the capacities of all of its people, and then find work \\nfor them to do.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     All the European countries have higher unemployment \\nrates than we do, but also stronger support systems for the \\nunemployed.  The Japanese unemployment rate has been going up.  \\nThey're going to adopt a stimulus that, even if you count it in its \\nmost rigorous terms, is three or four times bigger than the one that \\nI have proposed to create jobs. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     In West Germany alone, the unemployment rate is now \\nabout as high as ours.  This is a big problem for advanced nations.  \\nIt costs a lot of money to add an extra employee, with a lot of \\npressure from low-wage producers in other countries that are growing \\ntheir own economies and trying to provide new opportunity for their \\npeople.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     But it is especially important for America for two \\nreasons:  One is, we have a whole lot of folks who, unless we move \\naggressively, will not have the education and skills we need to be \\ncompetitive and productive in a nation like this.  The second is, \\neven if we educate them all, if there aren't jobs they will be robbed \\nof the fruits of their educational labors.  People need to be able to \\nwork in this country.  (Applause.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     We have always had some unemployment; and, indeed, some \\nof it is normal.  You've always got some people leaving jobs and \\nmoving around the country and doing first one thing and another.  We \\nhave now, at this moment in our history, the necessity for all big \\norganizations, including the government, to reexamine the way they \\nare organized and who ask whether there are too many people working \\nat some kinds of jobs.  But in the whole, we must still be able to \\ncreate jobs in a country like America, to provide people with the \\nchance to work.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     It's going to be difficult for me to make the welfare \\nreform proposals that I will make to Congress in the next couple of \\nmonths -- it's going to be hard for me to make those work if, at the \\nend of all this work, to get off welfare there isn't a job.  \\n(Applause.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     So we have two tasks.  One is to develop the capacity of \\nthe American people to perform without regard to race or income or \\nthe circumstances of their birth.  The other is to make sure that \\nthere are some opportunities for them to bring to bear for their \\ntalent and to be rewarded with a paycheck.  It is a great challenge.  \\nI do not pretend that all of the answers are simple.  But I know if \\nyou want to ask the American people, all of them, to be more \\nresponsible, if you want to recreate a sense of community in this \\ncountry that bridges the lines of race and income and region, you \\nhave got to have opportunity in that mix. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     A part of our vision for America has to be a future for \\nevery young person in this country who's willing to play by the rules \\nand work hard and strive for the end of the rainbow.  There has to be \\nsomething at the end of that rainbow.  And that is what we are \\nbasically here to talk about today:  What can we all do as partners, \\nrecognizing none of us can do it alone, to develop the capacities of \\nour people to succeed wherever they live and whatever their \\nbackground.  And then, what can we do to make sure that there's \\nsomething there for them to do?\\n\\n\\t     The summer jobs program we're discussing today is an \\nintegral part of that plan, because it will promote the values of \\nwork and opportunity and fairness, community.  It will put the people \\nfirst, and it does have a partnership between the public and private \\nsector.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I said when I addressed the United States Congress in \\nFebruary on this program that I would seek to create about 700,000 \\nextra summer jobs from government sources and then challenge the \\nAmerican business community to meet that target so that we can create  \\nmore than a million new summer jobs over and above what had been \\ncreated before.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Many, many people have responded to that challenge.  And \\nJerry is just a shining example of that which has been replicated in \\nthis room and around the country -- people who are going to do more \\nthan they otherwise would in the private sector to give young people \\na work experience.  And it is terribly important.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I want to emphasize that this summer jobs program is \\npart of an overall commitment to increase the capacity of the \\nAmerican people -- from retraining defense workers who lose their \\njobs and other adults who need to acquire new skills; to improving \\nthe transition from school to work for young people who don't go to \\ncollege but do need at least two years of post-high school training \\neither on the job or in a community college or a vocational setting, \\nso that they can be competitive workers, making it possible for more \\npeople to go on to college who do want to go.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     All these things are part and parcel of a comprehensive \\nplan.  It's also important, as I said, that we create more jobs.  The \\nemergency jobs program that I asked the Congress to adopt would \\ncreate a half a million extra jobs over the next year and a half, and \\nthat would reduce the unemployment rate by a half a percent.  It \\nwould also enable us to absorb more young people coming into the work \\nforce in jobs that otherwise will not be created.\\n\\t     \\n\\t      It also will help a lot of cities and counties to \\ninvest in things that need to be done at the grass-roots level --\\nprojects long delayed, water projects, sewer projects, park projects, \\nnew industries and particularly in small and medium-size communities \\n-- a whole range of things that will improve the economy and improve \\nthe environment.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     The summer jobs program is an important part of that \\nbecause we have tried for the first time, through the work of the \\nLabor Department and the Education Department and through reaching \\nout to people like you, to make this more than just a one-shot summer \\njobs program; to integrate it with private sector efforts; to \\nhopefully replicate it in each coming summer; to move these young \\npeople into further educational opportunities and to further job \\nopportunities; and to have a strong, meaningful education component \\nto these summer jobs -- something that the United States government \\nhas never fully emphasized before.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     A lot of these young people, as you well know, because \\nthey come from difficult backgrounds, because they go to school in \\ndifficult and challenging circumstances, need extra help in building \\ntheir basic skills in math and language, reasoning and in other \\nareas.  And a lot of educational studies show that young people who \\nhave difficulty in school often forget as much as 30 percent of what \\nthey learn over the summer and then that has to be repeated the next \\nyear.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     What we are trying to do here is to give people the \\nopportunity to learn good work habits and to reinforce their learning \\nskills and to put them together; and then, hopefully, over the next \\ncouple of years, if our entire program passes, to give every school \\nin this country the opportunity to have a good work and learning \\nenvironment.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     There will be more applied academics, more opportunities \\nfor people to learn and work during the school year, so that this \\nwill not simply be an isolated moment for these young folks, but will \\nbe a part of building a whole new educational experience, a whole new \\nwork experience, and moving on a pathway to a better future.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     The summer jobs programs are not designed to be make-\\nwork jobs.  They're designed to make a future for the people holding \\nthe job.  And that's what they will do.  In the process, they'll help \\nto build local communities, to strengthen local economies, to solve \\nlocal problems.  Real jobs -- renovating housing, repairing public \\nbuildings, doing clerical work, providing nursing assistance in \\nhospitals, supervising and training children at child care centers, \\nand learning all the way.  Challenging young people to learn while \\nthey earn, but letting them earn.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     You know, it's very difficult to make a case to people \\nwho have never seen opportunity on their own street that they should \\ndo this, that, or the other thing if there's no evidence of the \\nopportunity that's at the end of the effort.  I have not been sparing \\nin going for the last year-and-a-half into places where it isn't \\nexactly popular to say it, and say I wanted to reform the welfare \\nsystem; I wanted to toughen child support; I wanted to require people \\nto work; I was sick and tired of people being irresponsible in the \\nuse of guns on the streets, and I wanted to change all that.  But if \\nyou're going to summon people to greater responsibility, you have to \\nreward them when they do the right thing with opportunity.  \\n(Applause.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     The young people we propose to put to work under our \\nprogram will spend 90 hours learning basic skills, such as math, \\nreading, writing -- either on the job in the classroom.  They will \\nstretch their minds as well as work up a sweat.  They will have a \\nsense of accomplishment.  It will literally be a summer challenge, \\nbut a challenge that will take them into a different life.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     So I want to ask all of you to support this effort even \\nas I, as your President, support your effort.  At the end of the \\nsummer we will evaluate all the young people who participate.  We'll \\nsee whether they, instead of falling behind over the summer \\nacademically as too many young people do, they stayed even or moved \\nahead.  I suspect that they will.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     This summer, Secretary Reich and Secretary Riley and I \\nwill be visiting many of your communities.  We'll really try to learn \\nfrom you which of these efforts are working, what we should do next \\nsummer, how we can build it in to what goes on during the school \\nyear, how we can build in our job training efforts and the works that \\nwe do with your companies to make sense of this whole thing -- so \\nthat we maximize the impact of the taxpayer dollar and your private \\ninvestments as well. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     We want to honor the companies and the communities, the \\nbusiness leaders and the young people who do the very best jobs this \\nsummer.  And, again, I want to say to all of you in private business \\nwho have matched our effort, I thank you.  And to all of you who \\nhaven't, and those across the country who may listen or learn about \\nthis event today, I want to implore other private employers to \\nstretch a little bit to give other young people a chance to work this \\nsummer.  I'm telling you, we cannot go through another 10 years when \\nwe don't give these children anything to say yes to.  If we exhort \\nthem to do right, we've got to be able to reward them.  (Applause.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     When the other speakers were talking, I was sitting up \\nhere on the platform, listening and reveling.  And they got talking \\nabout work, and I got to thinking about all the different things I've \\ndone to make a living in my life.  When I was 13, I made a very \\nfoolish short-term business investment:  I set up a comic book stand \\nand sold two trunks full of comic books.  Made more money than I had \\never had in my life.  But if I had saved those trunks, they'd be \\nworth $100,000 today.  (Laughter.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     That does not mean young people should not be \\nentrepreneurial.  It just means that you can't foresee a generation \\nahead.  I have mowed yards and cleared land and built houses and \\nworked in body shops and the parts departments of a car dealership.  \\nAnd I've done a lot of different things for a living.  Some \\npeople say I got into politics to escape work.  (Laughter.)  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I learned something from every job I ever had.  But I \\ngrew up in a generation where I literally did not know a living soul \\nwithout regard to race or income who wanted to work who didn't have a \\njob.  I grew up in a generation when all you had to really say to \\npeople is, get an education and you'll be all right.  You'll get a \\njob and you'll make more money next year than you did this year.  Now \\nI live in a generation full of people, most of whom don't make any \\nmore money in real dollars than they did 10 years ago and they're \\nworking longer hours and they're paying more for the basics of life.  \\nAnd we are now wondering whether we can create the jobs that these \\nyoung people want.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Now, I want to close by reemphasizing these two things:  \\nIt doesn't matter what kind of economic policies this administration \\npursues, or how much productivity increases there are in the private \\nsector, if young Americans don't get a good education, don't learn \\nhow to work and can't be productive, those jobs will not be created \\nin this country.  Machines will do the work or the work will be done \\noff-shore by people who have the same skill levels and can work for a \\nthird or a fourth or a fifth the wages.  So nothing we can do \\neconomically will matter unless we build the skills and capacities of \\nAmerica's work force.  And anybody that pretends otherwise is just \\nkidding.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     On the other hand, we need to be honest.  Every wealthy \\ncountry in the world, including the United States, is having \\ndifficulty creating jobs.  If I knew everything that needs to be done \\nI'd be glad to tell you and we   could just call off the whole \\ndeliberations of Congress and everything else.  I don't have all the \\nanswers.  But I know this:  Doing nothing is not the answer.  \\n(Applause.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     And so the jobs program that I have presented to \\nCongress, with the summer jobs, with the money for the cities and the \\ncounties, through the Community Development Program, with the \\ninfrastructure money, is a small part of a big budget.  It is an \\nattempt to engage in an experiment to see whether or not, with the \\neconomy recovering in terms of corporate profit, we can give a little \\nboost to it, give opportunities to young people, create a half a \\nmillion jobs and maybe get the engine going again.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Most of the jobs in this program are going to be jobs in \\nthe private sector, not government jobs, even though it's government \\nmoney.  And the lion's share of the work in rebuilding the American \\neconomy obviously will come from the private sector.  That's the kind \\nof system we have and it works pretty well.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     But this is the challenge we have.  So I ask all of you \\nhere today to support the summer jobs program, to ask your friends \\nand neighbors to support it, to go back home and ask your employers \\nto make a little extra effort; to do what you can to help me pass the \\nfunds to create the 700,000 jobs that the United States government \\nshould create this summer, so that together we can have this \\npartnership.  Because more than anything else, we have to give a \\nfuture -- a future that our young people can believe in.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     We need to send them a message that here in America if \\nyou study hard and work hard, if you obey the law and contribute \\nsomething to your community, you will be rewarded by your country.  \\nYou can build a future from you own dreams. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     That has always been the promise of America.  Together \\nthat's what this summer of challenge needs to be:  a reaffirmation of \\nthe promise of America for so many young people to whom that promise \\nhas been an illusion.  We can make it a reality.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Thank you very much.  (Applause.)\",\n  '\\nWe all know this will never happen.

Thanks again for info!',\n  '\\nUndoubtedly.  In fact, it is the fact that hospitals frequently compete\\nfor physicians rather than for patients that (in part) complicates and \\nundermines a simplistic free-market analysis of the market for medical care.\\n\\n\\nOnce again, there is no evidence that this is true in regard to kidney\\ndialysis.  Although price controls have promoted an expansion of services\\nto a much greater volume of patients, RD is still a profitable service.\\nOtherwise, one would expect to see evidence of rationing rather than the\\nvast expansion that has occurred.\\n\\n\\nCan you spell \"loss leader?\"  I knew you could.  Grocery stores do not\\nattempt to make up the loss on an individual product by selling more of\\nit.  In fact, your argument above is that kidney dialysis is a loss leader \\nfor other medical treatments where lost revenue can be regained.  \\n\\nBut the evidence does not support this contention.  Rather, it appears that\\nprice controls have disciplined the market by forcing an expansion of\\nservice and development of improved lower-cost technology to provide \\ncomparable benefits.  Providers continue to profit from RD, they simply\\nmake less on each treatment than they would have if the price had \\nrisen at the rate that uncontrolled treatments have.\\n\\nThere is no question that had price controls forced the price of RD \\nsubstantially below its actual cost that some or all of the doomsday\\npredictions of free-market advocates would have been seen -- restriction\\nof service, lagging technological development, etc.  Likewise, it appears\\nthat in the VA and armed forces medical care systems, where providers \\nare government agencies, some of these negative impacts may occur.  \\n(RD patients in the VA system in Spokane, for example, must travel to\\nSeattle, 300 miles away, for treatment.)  \\n\\nThe bottom line, however, is that this is an example of government \\nintervention (of a rather extreme sort) that appears to have had beneficial\\nresults for both providers and consumers.  Claims that \"government\\nbureaucracy\" inevitably leads to undesirable outcomes in the marketplace\\nshould take such such cases into account.\\n\\njsh\\n',\n  '\\nOk, this is the only thing I will comment on from Stan at this time...\\npart of this forum we call rec.scouting is for policy discussions and\\nrelated topics.

Covey\" &lt;covey+@andrew.cmu.edu&gt;\\nSubject: Gun Stats & Mortal Risks\\nDate: Mon, 15 Feb 1993 18:35:05 -0500 (EST)\\n\\n\\nFolks,\\n\\nHail from the nether world.  On February 4th, the Wall Street Journal\\ncarried a front-page article by Erik Larson entitled \"Armed Force.\"  I\\nfelt a reply was in order to his citation of the notorious scare stat\\nthat \"A Gun is 43 times more likely to kill than to protect.\"  I sent\\nthe following to the WSJ.\\n\\n-----\\n\\nGun Stats & Mortal Risks\\n\\nPreston K. Covey\\n\\n\\n\\tErik Larson~s even-handed article on Paxton Quigley (~Armed Force,~\\n2/4/93, WSJ) cites the world~s most notorious ~statistic~ regarding guns\\nin the home:  ~A pioneering study of residential gunshot deaths in King\\nCounty, Washington, found that a gun in the home was 43 times more\\nlikely to be used to kill its owner, spouse, a friend or child than to\\nkill an intruder.~  The ~43 times~ stat is everywhere these days;  it\\nhas grown in media lore like the proverbial urban myth: it was inflated\\nby one pugilistic talk-show pundit to ~93.~  Given the shock value of\\nthe finding, the conclusion of the 1986 New England Journal of Medicine\\n(NEJM) study is remarkably understated:  ~The advisability of keeping\\nfirearms in the home for protection must be questioned.~ \\n \\n\\tResponsible people should indeed question the risks and benefits of\\nbringing a firearm into their home.   But what we need to know is this: \\nWhat exactly are the risks and benefits?  The NEJM testimony is neither\\nthe whole truth about the benefits nor nothing but the truth about the\\nrisks.  Further, as with motor vehicles, we want to know:  What control\\ndo we have over the risks and benefits?  And, as with the risks of\\ncancer or heart disease or auto accidents:  How can we minimize the\\nrisks?  Like raw highway death tolls, the NEJM stat is not very helpful\\nhere. \\n\\n\\tThe NEJM finding purports to inform us, but it is framed to warn us\\noff.  It is widely promulgated in the media as a ~scare stat,~ a\\nmisleading half-truth whose very formulation is calculated to prejudice\\nand terrify.  The frightful statistic screams for itself:  The risks far\\noutweigh the benefits, yes?   What fool would run these risks?   If your\\ncar were 43 times more likely to kill you, a loved one, a dear friend or\\nan innocent child than to get you to your destination,  should you not\\ntake the bus?  \\n\\n\\tUncritical citation puts the good name of statistics in the bad company\\nof lies and damned lies.   Surely, we can do better where lives are at\\nstake.   Let~s take a closer look at this risky business:\\n\\n\\tThe ~43 times~ stat of the NEJM study is the product of dividing the\\nnumber of home intruders/aggressors justifiably killed in self-defense\\n(the divisor) into the number of family members or acquaintances  killed\\nby a gun in the home (the dividend).  The divisor of this risk equation\\nis 9: in the study~s five-year sample there were 2 intruders and 7 other\\ncases of self-defense.  The dividend is 387:  in the study there were 12\\naccidental deaths, 42 criminal homicides, and 333 suicides.  387 divided\\nby 9 yields 43.  There were a total of 743 gun-related deaths in King\\nCounty between 1978 and 1983,  so the study leaves 347 deaths outside of\\nhomes unaccounted.\\n\\n\\tThe NEJM~s notorious ~43 times~ statistic is seriously misleading on\\nsix counts:\\n\\n\\t1.  The dividend is misleadingly characterized in the media:  the ~or\\nacquaintances~ of the study (who include your friendly drug dealers and\\nneighborhood gang members) is equated to ~friends.~  The implication is\\nthat the offending guns target and kill only beloved family members,\\ndear friends, and innocent children.  Deaths may all be equally tragic,\\nbut the character and circumstance of both victims and killers are\\nrelevant to the risk.  These crucial risk factors are masked by the\\ncalculated impression that the death toll is generated by witless\\nWaltons shooting dear friends and friendly neighbors.  This is\\ncriminological hogwash.\\n\\n\\t2.   The study itself does not distinguish households or environs\\npopulated by people with violent, criminal, or substance-abuse histories\\n-- where the risk of death is very high -- versus households inhabited\\nby more civil folk (for example, people who avoid high-risk activities\\nlike drug dealing, gang banging and wife beating) -- where the risk is\\nvery low indeed.  In actuality, negligent adults allow fatal but\\navoidable accidents; and homicides are perpetrated mostly by people with\\nhistories of violence or abuse, people who are identifiably and\\ncertifiably at ~high risk~ for misadventure.  To ignore these obvious\\nrisk factors in firearm accidents and homicides is as misleading as\\nignoring the role of alcohol in vehicular deaths: by tautology, neither\\ngun deaths nor vehicular deaths would occur without firearms or\\nvehicles; but the person and circumstance of the gun owner or driver\\ncrucially affect the risk. \\n\\n\\t3.  One misleading implication of the way the NEJM stat is framed is\\nthat the mere presence of a gun in the home is much more likely to kill\\nthan to protect, and this obscures -- indeed, disregards -- the role of\\npersonal responsibility.  The typical quotation of this study (unlike\\nLarson~s) attributes fatal agency to the gun:  ~A gun in the home is 43\\ntimes as likely to kill . . . .~  (The Center to Prevent Handgun\\nViolence, a major promulgator of the NEJM statistic, uses this\\nparticular formulation.)  We can dispense with the silly debate about\\nwhether it~s people or guns that accomplish the killing:  again, by\\ntautology, gun  deaths would not occur without the guns.  The question\\nbegged is how many deaths would occur anyway, without the guns.  In any\\ncase, people are the death-dealing agents, the guns are their lethal\\ninstruments.  The moral core of the personal  risk factors in gun deaths\\nare personal responsibility and choice.  Due care and responsibility\\nobviate gun accidents; human choice mediates homicide and suicide (by\\ngun or otherwise).  The choice to own a gun need not condemn a person to\\nNEJM~s high-risk pool.  The gun does not create this risk by itself. \\nPeople have a lot to say about what risk they run with guns in their\\nhomes.  For example, graduates of Paxton Quigley~s personal protection\\ncourse do not run the touted ~43 times~ risk any more than skilled and\\nsober drivers run the same risks of causing or suffering vehicular death\\nas do reckless or drunk drivers.  Undiscriminating actuarials disregard\\nand obscure the role of personal responsibility and choice, just as they\\ndisregard and obscure the role of socio-economic, criminological and\\nother risk-relevant factors in firearm-related death.  This is why we\\nresent insurance premiums and actuarial consigment to risk pools whose\\nnorms disregard our individualities.  Fortunately, nothing can consign\\nus to the NEJM risk pool but our own lack of choice or responsibility in\\nthe matter.\\n\\n\\t4.  Suicide accounts for 84% of the deaths by gun in the home in the\\nNEJM study.  As against the total deaths by gun in King County,\\nincluding those outside the home, in-house suicides are 44% of the total\\ndeath toll, which is closer to the roughly 50% proportion found by other\\nstudies.  Suicide is a social problem of a very different order from\\nhomicide or accidents.  The implication of the NEJM study is that these\\nsuicides might not occur without readily available guns.  It is true\\nthat attempted suicide by gun is likely to succeed.  It is not obviously\\ntrue that the absence of a gun would prevent any or all of these\\nsuicides.  This is widely assumed or alleged, but the preponderance of\\nresearch on guns and suicide actually shows otherwise, that this is\\nwishful thinking in all but a few truly impulsive cases.  (See:  Bruce\\nL. Danto et al., The Human Side of Homicide,  Columbia University Press,\\n1982;  Charles Rich et al.,  ~Guns and Suicide,~  American Journal of\\nPsychiatry,  March 1990.)  If suicides were removed from the dividend of\\nthe NEJM study~s risk equation, the ~43 times~ stat would deflate to\\n~six.~  The inclusion of suicides in the NEJM risk equation -- like the\\ncauses, durability, or interdiction of suicidal intent itself -- is a\\nprofoundly debatable matter.  Quotations of the NEJM study totally\\ndisregard this issue.\\n\\n\\t5.  Citations of the NEJM study also mislead regarding the estimable\\nrate of justifiable and excusable homicide.  Most measures, like the\\nNEJM homicide rate, are based on the immediate disposition of cases. \\nBut many homicides initially ruled criminal are appealed and later ruled\\nself-defense.  In the literature on battered women, immediate case\\ndispositions are notorious for under-representing the rate of\\njustifiable or excusable homicide. Time~s January 18, 1993, cover story\\non women ~Fighting Back~ reported one study~s finding that 40% of women\\nwho appeal have their murder convictions thrown out.  Time~s July 17,\\n1989, cover story on a week of gun deaths reported 51% of the domestic\\ncases as shootings by abuse victims; but only 3% of the homicides were\\nreported as self-defense.  In a May 14, 1990, update, Time  reported\\nthat 12% of the homicides had eventually been ruled self-defense. In\\nTime~s sample, the originally reported rate of self-defense was in error\\nby a factor of four.  The possibility of such error is not acknowledged\\nby promulgators of the NEJM statistic. \\n\\n\\t6.  While both the dividend and the product of the NEJM risk equation\\nare arguably inflated, the divisor is unconscionably misleading.  The\\ndivisor of this equation counts only aggressors who are killed,  not\\naggressors who are successfully thwarted without being killed or even\\nshot at.   The utility of armed self-defense is the other side of the\\ncoin from the harms done with guns in homes.  What kind of moral idiocy\\nis it to measure this utility only in terms of killings ?  Do we measure\\nthe utility of our police solely in terms of felons killed  -- as\\nopposed to the many many more who are otherwise foiled, apprehended, or\\ndeterred?  Should we not celebrate (let alone count ) those cases where\\nno human life is lost as successful armed defenses?  The question posed\\nto media that cite the NEJM scare stat is this:  Why neglect the\\ncompendious research on successful armed defense, notably by\\ncriminologist Gary Kleck (Point Blank: Guns and Violence in America ,\\nAldine de Gruyter, 1992)?\\n\\tKleck~s estimations of the rate and risk of defensive firearm use are\\nbased on victimization surveys as well as other studies:  the rate is\\nhigh (about one million a year) and the risk is good (gun defenders fare\\nbetter than anyone, either those who resort to other forms of resistance\\nor those who do not resist).  Dividing one million gun defenses a year\\nby 30,000 annual gun deaths (from self-defense, homicides, suicides, and\\naccidents) yields 33.  Thus, we can construct a much more favorable\\nstatistic than the NEJM scare stat:  \\n\\nA gun is 33 times more likely to be used to defend against assault or\\nother crime than to kill anybody.   \\n\\n\\tOf course, Kleck~s critics belittle the dividend of this calculation;\\nwhat is good news for gun defenders is bad news for gun control.  We\\nshould indeed question the basis and method of Kleck~s high estimation\\nof defensive firearm use, as I have questioned the NEJM statistic. \\nClearly, the issue of how to manage mortal risks is not settled by\\nuncritical citation of statistics.   One thing troubles me still:  we\\ncan hardly escape the unquestioned NEJM scare stat in our media,  but we\\nhardly ever find Kleck~s good work mentioned,  even critically.\\n',\n  'I believe we are down to two:  the 15-day and the 60-day.  (I don\\'t remember \\na 30-day, but rather a 21-day.  Anyways, it\\'s gone now.)  The period length \\nis a minimum, not a maximum.  You can keep a guy on the 15-day for as long \\nas you want, IF he\\'s still certified as injured.  The player must be \\nperiodically re-evaluated to determine if he\\'s still injured (thus you \\ncannot park a player on the DL who maybe is out of options and you do not \\nwish to expose to waivers).  If you get someone qualified for the 60-day \\nthat reduces the frequency of re-evaluations.  There is no longer, I \\nbelieve, any limit to the number of players you can place on the DL.

In that posting\\nI made sure I used the word \"public\".  Public revelation contains\\nGod\\'s truth intended for everyone to believe.  The revelation contained\\nin the Bible is a significant subset of public revelation.  Private\\nrevelation is revelation that God gives to an individual.  He may speak\\ndirectly to the individual, He may send an angel, or He may send the\\nVirgin Mary or some lesser saint.  The only person who is required to\\nbelieve a private revelation is the person to whom it is revealed.\\nDevotional practices may be based on reported private revelations,\\nbut doctrines can not.\\n\\nWhen an alleged private revelation attracts sufficient attention, the\\nChurch may investigate it.  If the investigation indicates a likelihood\\nthat the alleged private revelation is in fact from God, it will be\\napproved.  That means that it can be preached in the Church.  However,\\nit is still true that no one is required to believe that it came from\\nGod.  A Catholic is free to deny the authenticity of even the most\\nwell attested and strongly approved private revelations, such as those\\nat Fatima and Lourdes.  (I suspect that few if any Catholics do reject\\nFatima and Lourdes, but if any do their rejection of them does not\\nmean they are not orthodox Catholics in good standing.)\\n\\nI do not have at hand a list of the criteria the Church uses in\\nevaluating an alleged private revelation--it\\'s not something I need\\nevery day--but I know that one of the primary requirements is that\\nnothing in the alleged private revelation can contradict anything\\nknown through public revelation\\n-------\\nMarty Helgesen\\nBitnet: mnhcc@cunyvm   Internet: mnhcc@cunyvm.cuny.edu',\n  \"\\nFlights of fancy, and other irrational approaches, are common.  The crucial\\nthing is not to sit around just having fantasies; they aren't of any use\\nunless they make you do some experiments.  I've known a lot of scientists\\nwhose fantasies lead them on to creative work; usually they won't admit\\nout loud what the fantasy was, prior to the consumption of a few beers.\\n\\n(Simple example: Warren Jelinek noticed an extremely heavy band on a DNA\\nelectrophoresis gel of human ALU fragments.  He got very excited, hoping that\\nhe'd seen some essential part of the control mechanism for eukaryotic\\ngenes.  This fantasy led him to sequence samples of the band and carry out\\nbinding assays.  The result was a well-conserved, 400 or so bp, sequence\\nthat occurs about 500,000 times in the human genome.  Unfortunately for\\nWarren's fantasy, it turns out to be a transposon that is present in\\nso many copies because it replicates itself and copies itself back into\\nthe genome.  On the other hand, the characteristics of transposons were\\nmuch elucidated; the necessity of a cellular reverse transcriptase was\\nrecognized; and the standard method of recognizing human DNA was created.\\nOther species have different sets of transposons.  Fortunately for me,\\nWarren and I used to eat dinner at T.G.I. Fridays all the time.)\\n\\n\\nI'm not sure that it's random.  But there is no known rational mechanism\\nfor generating a rich set of interesting hypotheses.  If you are really\\nworking in an unknown area, it is unlikely that you will have much sense\\nof what might or might not be true; under those circumstances, the best\\nthing to do is just follow whatever instincts you have.  If they are wrong,\\nyou will find out soon enough; but at least, you will find out _something_.\\nIf you try to do experiments at random, with no prior conceptions at all\\nin mind, you will probably get nowhere.\\n\\n\\nUnfortunately, the critical function does sometimes become hostage to\\nnon-rational forces.  Then we get varieties of pathological science:\\nLysenko, Mirsky's opposition to DNA-as-gene, cold fusion, and so forth.\\n\\n\\nI don't agree that this follows.  In fact, this is _exactly_ the point at\\nwhich I disagree with Feyerabend.  It is a most important part of the\\nculture of science that one keeps one's jealousies out of the refereeing\\nprocess.  Failures there are aplenty, but, on the whole, things work out.\\n\\nAnother point: there are a couple of senses of the phrase ``experimental\\ndesign''.  I'd say that the less rational part is in experimental _choice_,\\nnot design.  Alexander Fleming (Proc. Royal Soc., 1922) chose to look for\\nbacteriophage in his own mucus for strange reasons (Phage had previously\\nbeen found in locust diarrhea; Fleming probably thought runny bottom, runny\\nnose, what the hell, it's worth a try.) but his method of looking for phage\\nwas well-designed to detect anything phage-like; in fact, he found lysozyme.\\n\\n\\nIt is not clear to me what you mean by rational vs. irrational.  Perhaps\\nyou can give a few examples of surprising experiments that were tried out\\nfor perfectly rational reasons, or interesting new theories that were first\\nadvanced from logical grounds.

Hundreds are missing.\\n\\nScattered amid the withered grass and bushes along a small valley \\nand across the hillside beyond are the bodies of last Wednesday\\'s \\nmassacre by Armenian forces of Azerbaijani refugees.\\n\\nFrom that hill can be seen both the Armenian-controlled town of \\nAskeran and the outskirts of the Azerbaijani military headquarters \\nof Agdam.

All the \\nsame, two attack helicopters circled continuously the nearby Armenian \\npositions.\\n\\nIn all, 31 bodies could be counted at the scene. At least another \\n31 have been taken into Agdam over the past five days.

The figures also \\ndo not include other as yet undiscovered bodies\\n\\nZahid Jabarov, a survivor of the massacre, said he saw up to 200 \\npeople shot down at the point we visited, and refugees who came \\nby different routes have also told of being shot at repeatedly and \\nof leaving a trail of bodies along their path. Around the bodies \\nwe saw were scattered possessions, clothing and personnel documents. \\nThe bodies themselves have been preserved by the bitter cold which\\nkilled others as they hid in the hills and forest after the massacre. \\nAll are the bodies of ordinary people, dressed in the poor, ugly \\nclothing of workers.\\n\\nOf the 31 we saw, only one policeman and two apparent national \\nvolunteers were wearing uniform.

The keywords `Monthly Posting\\'\\nwill always appear to make killing this article easy for users of\\nnewsreaders with kill facilities.  This article is posted to all autos\\ngroups, but followups are directed only to rec.autos.  If you don\\'t\\nunderstand what this means, ask your system administrator for help, or at\\nleast for copies of the newuser documentation.  Failing that, please\\nsubscribe to the newsgroup news.announce.newusers and read the\\ndocumentation provided there.\\n\\nIntroduction to the Rec.Autos newsgroup hierarchy:\\n\\nrec.autos.tech\\n\\nis intended for technical discussions of automobiles, their design,\\nconstruction, diagnosis, and service.  Other discussions are largely\\ninappropriate, especially For Sale ads.\\n\\nrec.autos.sport\\n\\nis intended for discussion of legal, organized competition involving\\nautomobiles.  Technical discussions are appropriate insofar as they apply\\nto competition vehicles.  Discussion from either of two viewpoints,\\nspectator and participant, is encouraged.  Arguments about sports cars are\\nlargely inappropriate, as are most other discussions.  For Sale ads are\\ninappropriate unless they are for competition vehicles and/or equipment.\\nDiscussions of illegal events are marginal; one should probably avoid\\nadvocating breaking the law.  (remember, the FBI reads Usenet!)\\n\\nrec.autos.driving\\n\\nis intended for discussions related to the driving of automobiles.\\nAlso, if you must discuss 55 vs. 65, or radar detectors, or &lt;insert\\nyour pet driving peeve&gt; boneheads, do it here.\\n\\nrec.autos.vw\\n\\nis intended for discussion of issues related to the use and ownership\\nof automobiles manufactured by Volkswagen (this includes VWs, Audis,\\nSeats, etc.)  It was created on the grounds that the info-vw mailing\\nlist was very successful.  It should not be presumed from the existence\\nof this group that it is appropriate to create many groups to cover many\\ndifferent marques; groups specific to individual marques should only be\\ncreated on demonstration of sufficient interest, via some avenue such as\\na mailing list.\\n\\nrec.audio.car\\n\\nis not properly part of the rec.autos.* hierarchy.  it is, however,\\nthe correct place for discussion of automotive audio equipment, and\\nso is mentioned here.\\n\\nrec.autos.antique\\n\\nis intended for the discussion of older cars (usually more than 25 years\\nold, although this is not a hard-and-fast rule.)\\n\\nalt.hotrod\\n\\nis not part of the hierarchy, but also of potential interest to the\\nrec.autos reader.  it is gatewayed to the moderated hotrod mailing\\nlist, and is for serious discussion of modifying and developing\\nperformance vehicles.\\n\\nalt.autos.rod-n-custom\\n\\nalso not part of the `official\\' hierarchy; devoted to that peculiar\\nAmerican hobby of customizing older cars.\\n\\nalt.autos.karting\\n\\nfor the discussion of the popular motorsport and hobby, karting.\\n\\nrec.autos\\n\\nis intended to capture discussion on all other automotive topics.\\n\\n\\nCrossposting:\\n\\nCrossposting occurs when more than one newsgroup name is included on\\nthe Newsgroups: line in the article header; such articles will appear\\nin all of the newsgroups listed.\\n\\nCrossposting is one of the most misunderstood and misused facilities on\\nUsenet.  You should only post to a group because you feel an article is\\nappropriate; you should NEVER crosspost just to reach a particular\\naudience.  This distinction is subtle, but important.  Radar Detector\\narticles, for example, are more-or-less appropriate in rec.autos.  They are\\nalmost never appropriate in sci.electronics or rec.ham-radio, and the fact\\nthat you might want to reach the audience in sci.electronics or\\nrec.ham-radio is NOT adequate justification for posting to either group.\\n\\nCrossposting between any or all of the rec.autos.* groups is usually\\ninappropriate; if you find yourself doing so, consider whether or not it is\\ntruly advisable, before sending your article.  Consider setting Followup-To:\\nto point to only one newsgroup if you feel you must crosspost.\\n\\nCrossposting between rec.autos.* and misc.consumers is chancy at best; in\\nparticular flame wars over the speed limit in the US and/or the use of\\nradar detectors should NEVER be crossposted between any of these groups.\\n\\nMost readers of sci.electronics and rec.radio.* couldn\\'t care less about\\nthe police radar and radar detector arguments that go on endlessly in\\nrec.autos.\\n\\nIt is an excellent idea to check the Newsgroups: and Followup-to:  lines of\\narticles before posting a followup.  In particular, be wary of posting to\\nmisc.test, rec.arts.startrek.*, or talk.bizarre, or any combination of these\\nthree.  The life you save may be your own.\\n\\nDistribution:\\n\\nThere is a field in the header of any news article which allows you to\\n(partially) control where the article goes; it is called the Distribution\\nfield.  It may be very useful for many reasons; it should also serve\\nas a reminder that news is a very large and widespread system.\\n\\nThe distribution of rec.autos.* is fairly extensive.  As of this writing, \\nthe Automotive newsgroups are known to reach most of Europe, Australia,\\nNew Zealand, and some locations in Japan.  With this in mind, I offer the\\nfollowing hints about use of the Distribution: field in your article\\nheaders, and on article content.\\n\\n1) Please take care not to send for-sale ads about clapped out Ford\\nMavericks in New Jersey to France or California; i doubt that anyone in\\neither place will care, except for my girlfriend, who for some strange\\nreason likes Mavericks (but only 4-door Mavericks, at that.)\\n\\n2) When posting technical questions, please include the market for which\\nyour car was manufactured.  For example, there are a number of differences\\nbetween a European-market Ford Escort and a US-market Escort.  Likewise,\\nall 1750cc and early 2000cc Alfa Romeos reached the US with Spica Fuel\\ninjection; European market cars usually got carbs (often Webers).  These\\ndifferences can be important to your readers; make your situation clear.\\nFailure to do so can lead to pointless flame wars and a significant\\nspread of misinformation.\\n\\n3) Be careful about your capacities and specifications when posting;\\nin the US we get a mix of Metric and English system values, whereas\\nEurope is almost entirely on the Metric system.  A future edition\\nof this monthly posting will contain a list of commonly-used\\nabbreviations that may not be known in some places that rec.autos\\nreaches; this cuts both ways so let us not be parochial about it.\\n\\n4) Use the Distribution: field to limit where your article goes, when\\npossible.  Within North America, the values na (north america), can\\n(canada), and usa may be used.  in addition, the two-letter state\\nabbreviations of the US are supported in some cases; e.g. if i wanted\\nto send an article only to New York and New Jersey, i could put\\n\"ny,nj\" in a Distribution field.  note that multiple, comma-separated\\nvalues are legal.  these distribution fields vary widely, however, so\\nyou should check with your local sysadmin to find out what is likely\\nto be supported in your area.\\n\\nThe Dangers of Overgeneralization:\\n\\nTo amplify a warning from the distribution section of this article:\\nBe wary of making foolish assumptions about all cars, tires, etc.  What is\\ntrue for a 1973 Buick with a 455cid engine may be quite utterly wrong for a\\n1976 Honda with a 1200cc engine.  Headlight laws in Sweden are decidedly\\ndifferent from those in Idaho.\\n\\nThe Need for Adequate Specification:\\n\\nWhen you ask a question, please give a reasonable amount of information;\\ne.g., if you have a question about your Honda, please specify year,\\nmodel, engine size, etc.  Otherwise, most answers to your question may be\\nquite useless.\\n\\n\\nConcerning Lemons:\\n\\nAt one time or another, every auto manufacturer has manufactured a lemon or\\ntwo; even Honda admits to this.  Please don\\'t waste everyone\\'s time by\\nannouncing to the world that your `brand x\\' automobile is terrible, so all\\n`brand x\\' automobiles are terrible, so no one should ever buy a car from\\nthe `brand x\\' company.  Such articles are worse than useless, because they\\ncause substantial wasted bandwidth while carrying little or no useful\\ninformation.\\n\\n\\nConcerning Flames:\\n\\nAs much as we might wish it, a flame-free newsgroup is something that most\\nlikely will never occur.  Here are some guidelines for flames and how\\nto deal with them (a list of flame-prone topics follows in the next section\\nof this posting):\\n\\nIf you post something truly obnoxious and inflammatory, don\\'t imagine for a\\nminute that including the words `No Flames\\' will work.  It won\\'t, and\\nyou\\'ll get exactly what you deserve.\\n\\nIf you\\'re going to flame, you\\'re more likely to get away with it if you can\\ncite a fact or maybe a well-known reference.  No one is likely to believe\\nbald, unsupported assertions.\\n\\nBe careful about who you choose to insult.  Consider not insulting anyone.\\n\\n\\nAsking the Question:\\n\\nIt is a bad idea to post a question and end it with a phrase like `Please\\nsend email, I don\\'t read this group\\'.  It is a much better idea to\\nend the question with `Please send email, if there is sufficient interest\\nI\\'ll summarize the results in a later posting.  I may miss posted responses\\nto this request\\'.\\n\\nAnswering the Question:\\n\\nIf someone wants to hop up their Yugo, don\\'t tell them to get a Mustang.\\nEither be silent, or give them useful advice.  If someone wants advice on\\ndefending a speeding ticket, don\\'t tell them to obey the law next time --\\nit\\'s offensive, presumes guilt which is not proven, and doesn\\'t directly\\naddress the original question.  In general, don\\'t post in order to see\\nyour words in print, and don\\'t post in order to enjoy feeling smug and\\nself-righteous.\\n\\n\\nStale and/or Inflammatory Topics:\\n\\nCertain topics are considered stale by `old timers\\'; while discussion of\\nthem is certainly ok, and new, factual information is welcome, ravings\\nabout them are extremely tiresome, and may get the person who posts them\\nignored altogether.  Some topics are naturally inflammatory; it is\\ndifficult if not impossible to have meaningful discussion of them.  Some\\nof these topics include the following:\\n\\n1)  the 55mph speed limit in the US: Pro and Con\\n\\n2)  discussions about the morality and legality of the sale and usage of\\n    radar detectors.\\n\\n3)  discussions over which radar detector is best.\\n\\n4)  discussions over what is a sports car (this is one reason why\\n    rec.autos.sport is not a `sports car\\' group -- everyone would argue\\n    about what constitutes a `sports car\\'.)\\n\\n5)  disputes over whether or not US Federal law protects the driver\\'s\\n    right to own and operate a radar detector\\n\\n6)  `Buy American\\' discussions\\n\\n7)  `clever\\' bumper stickers and personalized license plates\\n\\n8)  &lt;insert nationality here&gt; cars are terrible\\n\\n9)  What kind of car did Maxwell Smart drive?\\n      [when I have a complete, accurate answer it will be added to the\\n          commonly-asked questions article which is also posted monthly.\\n          Until then, please don\\'t waste bandwidth on this topic. -- rpw]\\n\\n\\n\\nPlease direct comments and suggestions about this article to:\\n\\n     welty@cabot.balltown.cma.com',\n  '\\nOther alternatives include output of vmstat, iostat, pstat and friends\\nwith various flags, or even better crash. \\n\\ne.g. on an RS/6000 (AIX 3.2) you can get lots of relatively\\nunpredicatble data out of crash.

Wordscan Plus is a product of Calera Recognition Systems.  \\nIt runs under Windows 3.1 and supports that Accufont Technology of the Hewlett \\nPackard Scanners.  \\n\\nWhen initially bringing up the software, it lets you select several options; \\n(1) text / graphics (2) input source ie scanner, fax file, disk file (3) \\nautomatic versus manual decomposition of the scanned image. \\n\\nI like manual decomposition since the software then lets me select which \\nparts of the document I would like scanned, and in what order.\\n\\nOnce an image is scanned, you can bring up the Pop-Up image verification.  The \\nsoftware gives you two \"errors\" at this point.  Blue which are words that were \\nconverted reliability, but do not match anything in the built-in dictionary.  \\nYellow shade, which are words that Wordscan Plus doesn\\'t think it converted \\ncorrectly at all.  I have found that the software should give itself more \\ncredit.  It is usually correct, instead of wrong.  If a word is shaded blue, \\nyou can add it to your personal dictionary.  The only problem is the personal \\ndictionary will only handle about 200 words.  I find this to be very limited, \\nconsidering how many medical terms are not in a normal dictionary. \\n\\nAfter a document is converted, you can save it in a multitude of word \\nprocessor formats.  Also any images that were captured can be stored in a \\nseperate TIFF or PCX file format.\\n\\nI was extremely impressed on the percent accuracy for fax files.

Since the early 1970s, the U.S. public health system has \\nbeen challenged by a myriad of newly identified pathogens and syndromes (e.g., \\nEscherichia coli O157:H7, hepatitis C virus, human immunodeficiency virus, \\nLegionnaires disease, Lyme disease, and toxic shock syndrome). The incidences \\nof many diseases widely presumed to be under control, such as cholera, \\nmalaria, and tuberculosis (TB), have increased in many areas. Furthermore, \\ncontrol and prevention of infectious diseases are undermined by drug \\nresistance in conditions such as gonorrhea, malaria, pneumococcal disease, \\nsalmonellosis, shigellosis, TB, and staphylococcal infections (2). Emerging \\ninfections place a disproportionate burden on immunocompromised persons, those \\nin institutional settings (e.g., hospitals and child day care centers), and \\nminority and underserved populations. The substantial economic burden of \\nemerging infections on the U.S. health-care system could be reduced by more \\neffective surveillance systems and targeted control and prevention programs \\n(3). \\n     This issue of MMWR introduces a new series, \"Emerging Infectious \\nDiseases.\" Future articles will address these diseases, as well as \\nsurveillance, control, and prevention efforts by health-care providers and \\npublic health officials. This first article updates the ongoing investigation \\nof an outbreak of E. coli O157:H7 in the western United States (4). \\n\\nReferences\\n\\n1. Burnet M. Natural history of infectious disease.

Washington \\n     On January 13, 1993, a physician reported to the Washington Department of \\nHealth a cluster of children with hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) and an \\nincrease in emergency room visits for bloody diarrhea. During January 16-17, a \\ncase-control study comparing 16 of the first cases of bloody diarrhea or \\npostdiarrheal HUS identified with age- and neighborhood-matched controls \\nimplicated eating at chain A restaurants during the week before symptom onset \\n(matched odds ratio OR=undefined; lower confidence limit=3.5). On January \\n18, a multistate recall of unused hamburger patties from chain A restaurants \\nwas initiated. \\n     As a result of publicity and case-finding efforts, during January-\\nFebruary 1993, 602 patients with bloody diarrhea or HUS were reported to the \\nstate health department. A total of 477 persons had illnesses meeting the case \\ndefinition of culture-confirmed E. coli O157:H7 infection or postdiarrheal HUS \\n(Figure 1). Of the 477 persons, 52 (11%) had close contact with a person with \\nconfirmed E. coli O157:H7 infection during the week preceding onset of \\nsymptoms. Of the remaining 425 persons, 372 (88%) reported eating in a chain A \\nrestaurant during the 9 days preceding onset of symptoms. Of the 338 patients \\nwho recalled what they ate in a chain A restaurant, 312 (92%) reported eating \\na regular-sized hamburger patty. Onsets of illness peaked from January 17 \\nthrough January 20. Of the 477 casepatients, 144 (30%) were hospitalized; 30 \\ndeveloped HUS, and three died. The median age of patients was 7.5 years \\n(range: 0-74 years). Idaho \\n     Following the outbreak report from Washington, the Division of Health, \\nIdaho Department of Health and Welfare, identified 14 persons with culture-\\nconfirmed E. coli O157:H7 infection, with illness onset dates from December \\n11, 1992, through February 16, 1993 (Figure 2A). Four persons were \\nhospitalized; one developed HUS. During the week preceding illness onset, 13 \\n(93%) had eaten at a chain A restaurant. California \\n     In late December, the San Diego County Department of Health Services was \\nnotified of a child with E. coli O157:H7 infection who subsequently died. \\nActive surveillance and record review then identified eight other persons with \\nE. coli O157:H7 infections or HUS from mid-November through mid-January 1993. \\nFour of the nine reportedly had recently eaten at a chain A restaurant and \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  5\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\nfour at a chain B restaurant in San Diego. After the Washington outbreak was \\nreported, reviews of medical records at five hospitals revealed an overall 27% \\nincrease in visits or admissions for diarrhea during December 1992 and January \\n1993 compared with the same period 1 year earlier. A case was defined as \\npostdiarrheal HUS, bloody diarrhea that was culture negative or not cultured, \\nor any diarrheal illness in which stool culture yielded E. coli O157:H7, with \\nonset from November 15, 1992, through January 31, 1993. \\n     Illnesses of 34 patients met the case definition (Figure 2B). The \\noutbreak strain was identified in stool specimens of six patients. Fourteen \\npersons were hospitalized, seven developed HUS, and one child died. The median \\nage of case-patients was 10 years (range: 1-58 years). A case-control study of \\nthe first 25 case-patients identified and age- and sex-matched community \\ncontrols implicated eating at a chain A restaurant in San Diego (matched \\nOR=13; 95% confidence interval CI=1.7-99). A study comparing case-patients \\nwho ate at chain A restaurants with well meal companions implicated regular-\\nsized hamburger patties (matched OR=undefined; lower confidence limit=1.3). \\nChain B was not statistically associated with illness. Nevada \\n     On January 22, after receiving a report of a child with HUS who had eaten \\nat a local chain A restaurant, the Clark County (Las Vegas) Health District \\nissued a press release requesting that persons with recent bloody diarrhea \\ncontact the health department. A case was defined as postdiarrheal HUS, bloody \\ndiarrhea that was culture negative or not cultured, or any diarrheal illness \\nwith a stool culture yielding the Washington strain of E. coli O157:H7, with \\nonset from December 1, 1992, through February 7, 1993. Because local \\nlaboratories were not using sorbitol MacConkey (SMAC) medium to screen stools \\nfor E. coli O157:H7, this organism was not identified in any patient. After \\nSMAC medium was distributed, the outbreak strain was detected in the stool of \\none patient 38 days after illness onset. \\n     Of 58 persons whose illnesses met the case definition (Figure 2C), nine \\nwere hospitalized; three developed HUS. The median age was 30.5 years (range: \\n0-83 years). Analysis of the first 21 patients identified and age- and sex-\\nmatched community controls implicated eating at a chain A restaurant during \\nthe week preceding illness onset (matched OR=undefined; lower confidence \\nlimit=4.9). A case-control study using well meal companions of case-patients \\nalso implicated eating hamburgers at chain A (matched OR=6.0; 95% CI=0.7-\\n49.8). Other Investigation Findings \\n     During the outbreak, chain A restaurants in Washington linked with cases \\nprimarily were serving regular-sized hamburger patties produced on November \\n19, 1992; some of the same meat was used in \"jumbo\" patties produced on \\nNovember 20, 1992. The outbreak strain of E. coli O157:H7 was isolated from 11 \\nlots of patties produced on those two dates; these lots had been distributed \\nto restaurants in all states where illness occurred. Approximately 272,672 \\n(20%) of the implicated patties were recovered by the recall. \\n     A meat traceback by a CDC team identified five slaughter plants in the \\nUnited States and one in Canada as the likely sources of carcasses used in the \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  6\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\ncontaminated lots of meat and identified potential control points for reducing \\nthe likelihood of contamination. The animals slaughtered in domestic slaughter \\nplants were traced to farms and auctions in six western states. No one \\nslaughter plant or farm was identified as the source. \\n     Further investigation of cases related to secondary transmission in \\nfamilies and child day care settings is ongoing. \\n\\nReported by: M Davis, DVM, C Osaki, MSPH, Seattle-King County Dept of Public \\nHealth; D Gordon, MS, MW Hinds, MD, Snohomish Health District, Everett; K \\nMottram, C Winegar, MPH, Tacoma-Pierce County Health Dept; ED Avner, MD, PI \\nTarr, MD, Dept of Pediatrics, D Jardine, MD, Depts of Anesthesiology and \\nPediatrics, Univ of Washington School of Medicine and Children\\'s Hospital and \\nMedical Center, Seattle; M Goldoft, MD, B Bartleson, MPH; J Lewis, JM \\nKobayashi, MD, State Epidemiologist, Washington Dept of Health.

This pathogen has since \\nemerged as an important cause of both bloody diarrhea and HUS, the most common \\ncause of acute renal failure in children. Outbreak investigations have linked \\nmost cases with the consumption of undercooked ground beef, although other \\nfood vehicles, including roast beef, raw milk, and apple cider, also have been \\nimplicated (3). Preliminary data from a CDC 2-year, nationwide, multicenter \\nstudy revealed that when stools were routinely cultured for E. coli O157:H7 \\nthat organism was isolated more frequently than Shigella in four of 10 \\nparticipating hospitals and was isolated from 7.8% of all bloody stools, a \\nhigher rate than for any other pathogen. \\n     Infection with E. coli O157:H7 often is not recognized because most \\nclinical laboratories do not routinely culture stools for this organism on \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  7\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\nSMAC medium, and many clinicians are unaware of the spectrum of illnesses \\nassociated with infection (4). The usual clinical manifestations are diarrhea \\n(often bloody) and abdominal cramps; fever is infrequent. Younger age groups \\nand the elderly are at highest risk for clinical manifestations and \\ncomplications. Illness usually resolves after 6-8 days, but 2%-7% of patients \\ndevelop HUS, which is characterized by hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, \\nrenal failure, and a death rate of 3%-5%. \\n     This report illustrates the difficulties in recognizing community \\noutbreaks of E. coli O157:H7 in the absence of routine surveillance. Despite \\nthe magnitude of this outbreak, the problem may not have been recognized in \\nthree states if the epidemiologic link had not been established in Washington \\n(1). Clinical laboratories should routinely culture stool specimens from \\npersons with bloody diarrhea or HUS for E. coli O157:H7 using SMAC agar (5). \\nWhen infections with E. coli O157:H7 are identified, they should be reported \\nto local health departments for further evaluation and, if necessary, public \\nhealth action to prevent further cases. \\n     E. coli O157:H7 lives in the intestines of healthy cattle, and can \\ncontaminate meat during slaughter. CDC is collaborating with the U.S. \\nDepartment of Agriculture\\'s Food Safety Inspection Service to identify \\ncritical control points in processing as a component of a program to reduce \\nthe likelihood of pathogens such as E. coli O157:H7 entering the meat supply. \\nBecause slaughtering practices can result in contamination of raw meat with \\npathogens, and because the process of grinding beef may transfer pathogens \\nfrom the surface of the meat to the interior, ground beef is likely to be \\ninternally contaminated. The optimal food protection practice is to cook \\nground beef thoroughly until the interior is no longer pink, and the juices \\nare clear. In this outbreak, undercooking of hamburger patties likely played \\nan important role. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued interim \\nrecommendations to increase the internal temperature for cooked hamburgers to \\n155 F (86.1 C) (FDA, personal communication, 1993). \\n     Regulatory actions stimulated by the outbreak described in this report \\nand the recovery of thousands of contaminated patties before they could be \\nconsumed emphasize the value of rapid public health investigations of \\noutbreaks. The public health impact and increasing frequency of isolation of \\nthis pathogen underscore the need for improved surveillance for infections \\ncaused by E. coli O157:H7 and for HUS to better define the epidemiology of E. \\ncoli O157:H7. \\n\\nReferences\\n\\n1.

Long-term use of \\nsmokeless tobacco is associated with nicotine addiction and increased risk of \\noral cancer (2) -- the incidence of which could increase if young persons who \\ncurrently use smokeless tobacco continue to use these products frequently (1). \\nTo monitor trends in the prevalence of use of smokeless tobacco products, \\nCDC\\'s 1991 National Health Interview Survey-Health Promotion and Disease \\nPrevention supplement (NHIS-HPDP) collected information on snuff and chewing \\ntobacco use and smoking from a representative sample of the U.S. civilian, \\nnoninstitutionalized population aged greater than or equal to 18 years. This \\nreport summarizes findings from this survey. \\n     The 1991 NHIS-HPDP supplement asked \"Have you used snuff at least 20 \\ntimes in your entire life?\" and \"Do you use snuff now?\" Similar questions were \\nasked about chewing tobacco use and cigarette smoking. Current users of \\nsmokeless tobacco were defined as those who reported snuff or chewing tobacco \\nuse at least 20 times and who reported using snuff or chewing tobacco at the \\ntime of the interview; former users were defined as those who reported having \\nused snuff or chewing tobacco at least 20 times and not using either at the \\ntime of the interview. Ever users of smokeless tobacco included current and \\nformer users. Current smokers were defined as those who reported smoking at \\nleast 100 cigarettes and who were currently smoking and former smokers as \\nthose who reported having smoked at least 100 cigarettes and who were not \\nsmoking now. Ever smokers included current and former smokers. Data on \\nsmokeless tobacco use were available for 43,732 persons aged greater than or \\nequal to 18 years and were adjusted for nonresponse and weighted to provide \\nnational estimates. Confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by using \\nstandard errors generated by the Software for Survey Data Analysis (SUDAAN) \\n(3). \\n     In 1991, an estimated 5.3 million (2.9%) U.S. adults were current users \\nof smokeless tobacco, including 4.8 million (5.6%) men and 533,000 (0.6%) \\nwomen. For all categories of comparison, the prevalence of smokeless tobacco \\nuse was substantially higher among men. For men, the prevalence of use was \\nhighest among those aged 18-24 years (Table 1); for women, the prevalence was \\nhighest among those aged greater than or equal to 75 years. The prevalence of \\nsmokeless tobacco use among men was highest among American Indians/Alaskan \\nNatives and whites; the prevalence among women was highest among American \\nIndians/Alaskan Natives and blacks. Among both men and women, prevalence of \\nsmokeless tobacco use declined with increasing education. Prevalence was \\nsubstantially higher among residents of the southern United States and in \\nrural areas. Although the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use was higher among \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 10\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\nmen and women below the poverty level, * this difference was significant only \\nfor women (p less than 0.05) (Table 1). \\n     Among men, the prevalence of current use of snuff was highest among those \\naged 18-44 years but varied considerably by age; the prevalence of use of \\nchewing tobacco was more evenly distributed by age group (Table 2). Although \\nwomen rarely used smokeless tobacco, the prevalence of snuff use was highest \\namong those aged greater than or equal to 75 years. \\n     An estimated 7.9 million (4.4% 95% CI=4.1-4.6) adults reported being \\nformer smokeless tobacco users. Among ever users, the proportion who were \\nformer smokeless tobacco users was 59.9% (95% CI=57.7-62.1). Among persons \\naged 18-24 years, the proportion of former users was lower among snuff users \\n(56.2% 95% CI=49.4-63.0) than among chewing tobacco users (70.4% 95% \\nCI=64.2-76.6). Among persons aged 45-64 years, the proportion of former users \\nwas similar for snuff (68.9% 95% CI=63.1-74.7) and chewing tobacco (73.5% \\n95% CI=68.9-78.1). \\n     Among current users of smokeless tobacco, 22.9% (95% CI=19.9-26.0) \\ncurrently smoked, 33.3% (95% CI=30.0-36.5) formerly smoked, and 43.8% (95% \\nCI=39.9-47.7) never smoked. In comparison, among current smokers, 2.6% (95% \\nCI=2.3-3.0) were current users of smokeless tobacco. \\n     Daily use of smokeless tobacco was more common among snuff users (67.3% \\n95% CI=63.2-71.4) than among chewing tobacco users (45.1% 95% CI=40.6-\\n49.6). \\n\\nReported by: Office on Smoking and Health, National Center for Chronic Disease \\nPrevention and Health Promotion; Div of Health Interview Statistics, National \\nCenter for Health Statistics, CDC. \\n\\nEditorial Note: The findings in this report indicate that the use of smokeless \\ntobacco was highest among young males. Adolescent and young adult males, in \\nparticular, are the target of marketing strategies by tobacco companies that \\nlink smokeless tobacco with athletic performance and virility. Use of oral \\nsnuff has risen markedly among professional baseball players, encouraging this \\nbehavior among adolescent and young adult males and increasing their risk for \\nnicotine addiction, oral cancer, and other mouth disorders (4). \\n     Differences in the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use among \\nracial/ethnic groups may be influenced by differences in educational levels \\nand socioeconomic status as well as social and cultural phenomena that require \\nfurther explanation. For example, targeted marketing practices may play a role \\nin maintaining or increasing prevalence among some groups, and affecting the \\ndifferential initiation of smokeless tobacco use by young persons (5,6). \\n     In this report, one concern is that nearly one fourth of current \\nsmokeless tobacco users also smoke cigarettes. In the 1991 NHIS-HPDP, the \\nprevalence of cigarette smoking was higher among former smokeless tobacco \\nusers than among current and never smokeless tobacco users. In a previous \\nstudy among college students, 18% of current smokeless tobacco users smoked \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 11\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\noccasionally (7). In addition, approximately 7% of adults who formerly smoked \\nreported substituting other tobacco products for cigarettes in an effort to \\nstop smoking (8). Health-care providers should recognize the potential health \\nimplications of concurrent smokeless tobacco and cigarette use. \\n     The national health objectives for the year 2000 have established special \\npopulation target groups for the reduction of the prevalence of smokeless \\ntobacco use, including males aged 12-24 years (to no more than 4% by the year \\n2000 objective 3.9) and American Indian/Alaskan Native youth (to no more \\nthan 10% by the year 2000 objective 3.9a) (9). Strategies to lower the \\nprevalence of smokeless tobacco use include continued monitoring of smokeless \\ntobacco use, integrating smoking and smokeless tobacco-control efforts, \\nenforcing laws that restrict minors\\' access to tobacco, making excise taxes \\ncommensurate with those on cigarettes, encouraging health-care providers to \\nroutinely provide cessation advice and follow-up, providing school-based \\nprevention and cessation interventions, and adopting policies that prohibit \\ntobacco use on school property and at school-sponsored events (5). \\n\\nReferences\\n\\n1.

Just turn on the engines\\nand touch down.  Of course, as Henry pointed out, vetical landings aren\\'t quite\\nthat simple.\\n\\n\\nWell, to be blunt, yes.  But at least you\\'re learning.\\n\\n\\nThe Soyuz vehicles use parachutes for the descent and then fire small rockets\\njust before they hit the ground.  Parachutes are, however, not especially\\npractical if you want to reuse something without much effort.  The landings\\nare also not very comfortable.  However, in the words of Georgy Grechko,\\n\"I prefer to have bruises, not to sink.\"\\n\\n',\n  ': &gt; The application creates window with a button \"Quit\" and \"Press me\".\\n: &gt; The button \"Press me\" pops up a dialog box. The strange feature of\\n: &gt; this program is that it always pops up the dialog box much faster the\\n: &gt; first time. If I try to pop it up a 2nd time (3rd, 4th .... time), \\n: &gt; it is *much* slower.\\n: \\n: The shell is waiting for the window-manager to respond to its\\n: positioning request.  The window-manager is not responding because\\n: it thinks the window is already in the right place.\\n: \\n: Exactly *why* the two components get into this sulk is unclear to\\n: me; all information greatly received.\\n\\nThanks for this clue, and thanks to Derek Ho also for a pointer in the\\nsame direction.\\n\\nOne solution, due to Derek Ho: when the popup is popped up, we SetValue\\nits location -- which on repeat popups will be unchanged from the\\nprevious popup. The slow response can be avoided by calling GetValue\\nfirst, and only using SetValue if the required location is different.\\nThe problem can also be avoided by making a tiny alteration in the\\nlocation of the popup, so that the SetValue really does change the\\nlocation of the popup. (We tried this just for a double check on the\\nsource of the problem.)\\n\\nThe solutions we have tried successfully are now as follows:\\n\\n1) Use \"twm\" or \"mwm\" rather than \"olwm\"\\n2) Use \"olwm\", with resource \"*wmTimeout: 10\"\\n3) Only reset the location of the popup window if it is truely changed.\\n\\nThis is obviously working around some bug somewhere.',\n  '\\nI think the point is being missed - that it is apparantly acceptable for\\nBig Government (Big Brother?) to use TANKS to control the people, as\\nlong as they don\\'t use the BIG GUN (but everything else is allright...).\\n\\nTanks deployed against civilians, let alone FIRING on them with crew\\nserved weaponry (a .50 Heavy Machine Gun is crew-served) is something\\nboth our press and government howl about instantly when done in some\\nother country.  Against civilians that have, at most, one-shot-at-a-time\\nLIGHT small arms.  Certainly nothing that places the people in or behind\\nthe tank in any real danger.  Molotov coctails?  A round from a rifle\\nor pistol deals with anybody approaching with one of those.  And \"snipers\"\\ntoo often turn out to be strays from other cops/guard/army gunfire.\\n\\nI don\\'t know about the other people in this group (or on the net) but\\nthe idea of tanks being used to control civilians, in anything that\\npretends to be a free society is outrageous.  When Big Government feels\\nit is necessary to use that kind of force to stomp out protests (even\\nviolent) of the citizens, that suggests that the government is totally\\nout of control, since that is effectively the government declaring war\\non its own people.  If the government was living up to its responsibility,\\ngovernment of the people BY THE PEOPLE, not the \\'lords\\' and other elites\\nwho want to keep their good thing going, the citizens wouldn\\'t feel the\\nneed to be resorting to acts that need to be squashed with a military\\nboot.  People do things like that because they have become convinced\\nthat it is the only option that remains, other attempts to have grievances\\nredressed have been ignored.  And yes, there is a criminal element that\\nwill exploit this, but the fact remains that the government has been\\nunresponsive or such acts wouldn\\'t be apt to happen.  Still not an excuse\\nto open up on civilians with tanks, heavy machine guns, or whatever.\\nIts the old \\'might makes right\\' philosophy that is the hallmark of a\\ngovernment going rogue:  They don\\'t like it? Tough. We will simply\\nsquash them under an iron boot.  Actually addressing their grievances\\nin other than token fashion with huge volumes of hot air is just too\\ninconvenient...  Sort of a variation on mushroom management:  Keep them\\nin the dark, Smother them with shit, and Crush them when ready...\\n\\nAnd these are the folks that many liberals are trying to arrange things\\nso that they will have a MONOPOLY on coercive force (firearms that are\\nthan expensive toys...) by gutting the Bill of Rights (cuz it just isn\\'t\\nPROGRESSIVE or doesn\\'t fit in with MODERN THINKING anymore)...\\n\\nUnbelievable.\\n\\nAnd I do believe amid the smoke, confusion, etc of a real riot situation,\\nthat it would be POSSIBLE for a tank to get away with firing the main gun\\ninto a building at close range?  One would hear an explosion among many\\nexplosions.  It is loud, but it is not going to stand out like a 1000\\npound bomb or a tactical nuke.  There would be a hole blown in the wall,\\nand some rubble, but with tanks knocking over walls, and other sources\\nof buildings turning into rubble, and other covering racket such as\\ngunfire, including 50\\'s tacking away, it would not stand out that much,\\nand could be explained by \"musta been a gas leak... \".  I think it could be\\ndone and not be reported under such conditions - it is POSSIBLE.  It is\\nnot like a tank driving down a quiet street on a Sunday afternoon, turning\\nand firing, you know.  THAT would stand out, and be pretty impossible\\nto cover up.\\n\\n\\n',\n  '',\n  'We have an old Sun3/60 here which gets occasional use.

Both the \"External Tank\" and\\n\"Wingless Orbiter\" options have been deleted from the SSF redesign\\noptions list. Today\\'s (4/23) edition of the New York Times reports\\nthat O\\'Connor told the panel that some redesign proposals have\\nbeen dropped, such as using the \"giant external fuel tanks used\\nin launching space shuttles,\" and building a \"station around\\nan existing space shuttle with its wings and tail removed.\"\\n\\nCurrently, there are three options being considered, as presented\\nto the advisory panel meeting yesterday (and as reported in\\ntoday\\'s Times).\\n\\nOption \"A\" - Low Cost Modular Approach\\nThis option is being studied by a team from MSFC. {As an aside,\\nthere are SSF redesign teams at MSFC, JSC, and LaRC supporting\\nthe SRT (Station Redesign Team) in Crystal City. Both LeRC and\\nReston folks are also on-site at these locations, helping the respective\\nteams with their redesign activities.} Key features of this\\noption are:\\n  -  Uses \"Bus-1\", a modular bus developed by Lockheed that\\'s\\n     qualified for STS and ELV\\'s. The bus provides propulsion, GN&C\\n     Communications, & Data Management. Lockheed developed this\\n     for the Air Force.\\n  -  A \"Power Station Capability\" is obtained in 3 Shuttle Flights.\\n     SSF Solar arrays are used to provide 20 kW of power. The vehicle\\n     flies in an \"arrow mode\" to optimize the microgravity environment.\\n     Shuttle/Spacelab missions would utilize the vehilce as a power\\n     source for 30 day missions.\\n  -  Human tended capability (as opposed to the old SSF sexist term\\n     of man-tended capability) is achieved by the addition of the\\n     US Common module. This is a modified version of the existing\\n     SSF Lab module (docking ports are added for the International\\n     Partners\\' labs, taking the place of the nodes on SSF). The\\n     Shuttle can be docked to the station for 60 day missions.\\n     The Orbiter would provide crew habitability & EVA capability.\\n  -  International Human Tended. Add the NASDA & ESA modules, and\\n     add another 20 kW of power\\n  -  Permanent Human Presence Capability. Add a 3rd power module,\\n     the U.S. habitation module, and an ACRV (Assured Crew Return\\n     Vehicle).\\n\\nOption \"B\" - Space Station Freedom Derived\\nThe Option \"B\" team is based at LaRC, and is lead by Mike Griffin.\\nThis option looks alot like the existing SSF design, which we\\nhave all come to know and love :)\\n\\nThis option assumes a lightweight external tank is available for\\nuse on all SSF assembly flights (so does option \"A\"). Also, the \\nnumber of flights is computed for a 51.6 inclination orbit,\\nfor both options \"A\" and \"B\".\\n\\nThe build-up occurs in six phases:\\n  -  Initial Research Capability reached after 3 flights. Power\\n     is transferred from the vehicle to the Orbiter/Spacelab, when\\n     it visits.\\n  -  Man-Tended Capability (Griffin has not yet adopted non-sexist\\n     language) is achieved after 8 flights. The U.S. Lab is\\n     deployed, and 1 solar power module provides 20 kW of power.\\n  -  Permanent Human Presence Capability occurs after 10 flights, by\\n     keeping one Orbiter on-orbit to use as an ACRV (so sometimes\\n     there would be two Orbiters on-orbit - the ACRV, and the\\n     second one that comes up for Logistics & Re-supply).\\n  -  A \"Two Fault Tolerance Capability\" is achieved after 14 flights,\\n     with the addition of a 2nd power module, another thermal\\n     control system radiator, and more propulsion modules.\\n  -  After 20 flights, the Internationals are on-board.

Please\\nanswer yes or no, Roger:\\n Can a pitcher cause the offensive players on his team to score more runs?\\nAL only, please.\\n\\nFor anyone else following along, it is a well-known and demonstrable fact\\nthat a team\\'s win-loss record is closely related to the number of runs the\\nteam scores and the number the team allows.

In fact, as a\\nrule of thumb, if teams A and B both score X runs and team A allows Y runs,\\nfor every 10 runs fewer than Y that team B allows, it will win another game.\\nSo, for instance, if we look at the 1991 Toronto Blue Jays, we find that\\nthey scored 780 runs and allowed 682, of which Morris allowed 114. All other\\nthings being equal, if Frank Viola, with his 3.44 ERA had replaced Jack\\nMorris for the 240.2 innings Morris threw (plausible, since Viola threw 238\\nfor Boston), the \"Red Jays\" would have allowed about 15 fewer runs, or\\nenough for 1-2 more wins. Now, that doesn\\'t take into account that Viola\\npitched half his innings in Fenway, which is a harder park to pitch in\\n(particularly for a lefthander) than Skydome. So, um, Roger. Unless you\\nreally do believe that a pitcher can somehow affect the number of runs\\nhis team scores, could you enlighten us to the fallacy in this\\nanalysis? Clearly, it would be foolhardy to claim that Viola would\\nnecessarily have put up a 3.44 if he had been on the Jay last year, but\\nthat is not the claim.

In the\\nGerman Weimar system, the Chancellor was not necessarily the leader of the\\nlargest Reichstag party; the Chancellor was appointed by the President and\\ngenerally was the leader of a coalition of parties who could form an effective\\nmajority in the Reichstag. Beyond that, the implication that Hitler rose to\\nthe Chancellorship because a majority of Germans wanted Nazi rule is false\\nas well. Before President Hindenburg appointed Hitler Chancellor in January\\n1933, the German people did not show a particular desire to be led either by\\nHitler or by the Nazi party. These are the results of the March 1932 election\\nfor President, the closest Hitler ever came to direct election: Hindenburg\\n49.6%, Hitler 30.1%, Thaelmann 13.2%, Duesterberg 6.8%. In the runoff election\\nin April the results were: Hindenburg 53%, Hitler 36.8%, Thaelmann 10.2%.\\nSo we can see that Hitler personally was supported by only about a third of\\nGerman voters.\\n\\nSimilarly, the Nazi party never received more than 37% of the vote in\\nReichstag elections. That occurred in July 1932. In the November 1932 election\\nthe Nazis *lost* two million votes and 34 seats, down from 230 to 196 out of\\nthe 608 in the Reichstag. Comparitively, the Socialists had 121 and the\\nCommunists 100. The Communists had gained 11 seats, and the German National\\nparty, which had supported the previous government, had picked up a million\\nof the Nazis' lost votes to gain 15 seats (up to 52). I think the other large\\nparty was the Catholic Center party (I don't know how many seats they had but\\nI think they were declining), and there were numerous other small parties.\\nThus the Nazi vote was on the decline at the time Hitler was appointed\\nChancellor.\\n\\nWhat brought Hitler to power was *not* the demand of the German people for\\nHitler or the Nazis to run things, but the inability of the other parties to\\nput their differences behind them in favor of forming an effective government\\nfor the country. Germany did not have an enduring democratic tradition, and\\ntheir parliamentary system lacked effective center parties that favored the\\ninterests of the majority of the population. Instead what they had was a\\nnumber of small parties who were unable to put aside their own specific\\nobjectives in order to combine against the Nazis, who were out to end the\\ndemocratic process. In fact, part of the problem was that some of the other\\nparties with substantial representation, like the Communists, were also\\nout to end the democratic process, but with different results in mind, and\\ngenerally didn't mind seeing parliamentary democracy go under.\\n\\nGermany had already had a non-Nazi Chancellor with a majority coalition\\nfor five months while the Nazis had been the largest Reichstag party, and\\nthere certainly was no danger of a revolution in favor of the Nazis.\\nIf anything the Nazis were starting to get desperate because they had failed\\nto get enough support to make Hitler President and their popular vote had\\nbegun to decline.\\n\\nHitler was not Hindenburg's first choice to be Chancellor, not even his\\nsecond choice. First, von Papen had been Chancellor since June 1932. After\\nthe November election when the Nazis *lost* seats, Hindenburg first prevailed\\non von Papen to remain as Chancellor. But there were intrigues behind his back\\nand support for him was lacking. So then Hindenburg turned to von Schleicher,\\nwho became Chancellor for two months. Eventually he too was unable to hold\\ntogether a working coalition of parties to oppose the Nazis, who refused to\\nparticipate in any government that was not led by a Nazi Chancellor. Some of\\nthe Nazi leadership, particularly Gregor Strasser who was the #2 man in the\\nparty at the time, wanted to participate in a coalition government. But others,\\nknowing the party's support was waning, figured that their best hope to gain\\npower lay in undermining the democratic process. Nevertheless, the country\\nwas governed for seven months by Chancellors who were not Nazis, even though\\nthe Nazis were the largest Reichstag party. The failure of these men to\\nachieve a working coalition was due to the inability of their coalition\\nparties to work together.\\n\\nHere's how William Shirer puts it in _The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich_:\\n\\n   The cardinal error of the Germans who opposed Nazism was their\\n   failure to unite against it. At the crest of their popular strength,\\n   in July 1932, the National Socialists had attained but 37 percent of\\n   the vote. But the 63 percent of the German people who expressed their\\n   opposition to Hitler were much too divided and shortsighted to combine\\n   against a common danger which they must have known would overwhelm\\n   them unless they united, however temporarily, to stamp it out.\\n\\nTrue, the German people supported Hitler after he became Chancellor. But\\nthat doesn't change the fact that there was not overwhelming support for him\\n*before* he was in power. The German people were not crying out for Hitler to\\ntake over, no matter how bad economic conditions were.

It is the \"L\" word -\\nLOSER !!\\n\\n\\tThat\\'s right. When we boil all the crap out of this argument, it\\nis all about WINNING and LOSING, and nothing else. Let me explain.\\n\\n\\tRemember the eighties ? No excuses. Nobody who can handle a mail\\nbuffer can claim they are \"too young\" to remember Ronald Reagan - yet.\\nThe eighties were about \"How America Learned to Win Once Again\". Then\\n(wouldn\\'t you know), we won so well that there was nothing left to win.\\nNo Cold War to endure. No nuclear holocaust. No more worlds to conquer\\n(We forgot about outer space long ago). The kind of overwhelming, no\\nholds barred success that killed Alexander the Great. Yes, there were a\\nfew \"little\" problems along the way - stock market meltdown here, an\\nS&L bailout there, a few revolts and crazy Middle Eastern dictators to\\ncontend with, but as Tacitus would tell ya\\', the God Augustus never had\\nit so good. \\n\\n\\tIn the meantime, there is guilt for winning, maybe a fear that one\\ndoesn\\'t deserve one\\'s bounty - or success. So there is a \"kinder and gentler\\ntype of politician these days, Bill Clinton, affirmative action, and lots of\\ndiscourse about people who \"don\\'t get it\". For those of us in the winning\\nbusiness, this kind of talk is mildly irritating, but there is still no \\nsuggestion of losing.\\n\\n\\tBut what do we find now ? To put it mildy, the stereotype of our \\n\"white male\" non-winner is Woody Hayes in the Rose Bowl, punching out \\nphotojournalists when those California fruits and nuts steal another one\\nwith a \"Hail Mary\" pass in the Fourth Quarter. (The whole idea behind \\'three\\nyards and a cloud of dust\\' is to wear your opponent down until he collapses\\nin the final period) But Woody just used his fists - Uzzies seem to be the \\nweapon of choice these days. \\n\\t\\n\\tWho is D-FENS, anyway ? The answer is as plain as the horn rims on \\nyour face. The guy is MICHAEL DOUGLAS, posing as a LOSER. This \\nis known as controversial casting. But that baggy short-sleeved white shirt \\nsure does look natural on Mike doesn\\'t it. Gordon Gekko will never look the \\nsame. (Though Woody always dressed that way.) Did we really expect Gekko to \\ntake it easy and enjoy that kind of wardrobe, without putting up a fuss ?\\n\\n\\tWhat we are starting to lose sight of is, that bashing D-FENS is \\nthe same game as bashing that poor African American slug that Clint Eastwood\\nused to blow away all the time. As that arch-WASP (male gender) George C. Scott\\ndeclaimed, \"Americans traditionally LOVE TO WIN. They love a winner, and will \\nnot tolerate a loser.\" And so on. \\n\\n\\tThe political implications are simple. If, as many socialists - and\\nDemocrats - do, you consider society a finite pie to a apportioned in some \\n\"equitable\" way, then you have to worry about who is a winner and who is a \\nloser to tell whose side you are on. That could be black women today, Asian\\nhomosexuals tommorrow, and yes indeed, white men some yet to be determined\\nday when the balance of the pie has finally swung against that (39%) \\nminority.\\n\\n\\tOr you can just blow the whole thing off and say - as do most\\nconservatives and all the libertarians - and act is if you didn\\'t care\\nwho\\'s winning and who\\'s losing. In some cases, you might say something\\nabout make sure the game is fair (equality of opportunity, not of condition).\\nIn the latter case, you might be able to identify yourself as a \\n\"neoconservative\" or a \"neoliberal\" depending on how much you want to limit\\nthe pot.\\n\\n\\tEither way you go, the way of the Winner is no longer the way to be\\npopular - at least after you graduate from High School (but you\\'ll still\\nbe popular at High School reunions). But it beats being a Nerd, as I \\nwould imagine Michael Douglas would now agree, and in the long run, it\\nis the only way to go. (Even in Hollywood, which treats Losers worse than any\\nother place in America except for New York and Washington, D.C. - and even in\\nColumbus, Ohio, which produced Alex Keaton, but no champion football teams in\\nthe eighties and the first quarter of the nineties) I\\'d like to \\nsee more Winners in this society, regardless of race, gender, religious \\npreference, and sexual orientation. Maybe we should even let a few more of \\nthem be white men !!

Dr. Noordewier has \\nappointments in both Computer Science and Biology at Rutgers, and \\nhas extensive experience in basic biological research in addition \\nto his current work in computational biology.\\n\\n12:00-2:45pm \"Introduction to Artificial Intelligence for \\n Biologists\"  Dr. Richard Lathrop (MIT & Arris Corp.)\\n\\nAn overview of the field of artificial intelligence will be \\npresented, as it relates to actual and potential biological \\napplications.  Fundamental techniques, symbolic programming \\nlanguages, and notions of search will be discussed, as well as \\nselected topics in somewhat greater detail, such as knowledge \\nrepresentation, inference, and machine learning.  The intended \\naudience includes biologists with some computational background, \\nbut no extensive exposure to artificial intelligence.  Dr. \\nLathrop, co-developer of ARIADNE and related technologies, has \\nworked in the area of artificial intelligence applied to \\nbiological problems in both academia and industry.\\n\\n3:00-5:45pm \"Neural Networks, Statistics, and Information Theory \\n in Biological Sequence Analysis\" Dr. Alan Lapedes (Los Alamos \\n National Laboratory) \\n\\nThis tutorial will cover the most rapidly-expanding facet of \\nintelligent systems for molecular biology, that of machine \\nlearning techniques applied to sequence analysis.  Closely \\ninterrelated topics to be addressed include the use of artifical \\nneural networks to elicit both specific signals and general \\ncharacteristics of sequences, and the relationship of such \\napproaches to statistical techniques and information-theoretic \\nviews of sequence data.  Dr. Lapedes, of the Theoretical \\nDivision at Los Alamos, has long been a leader in the use of such \\ntechniques in this domain.\\n\\n3:00-5:45pm \"Genetic Algorithms and Genetic Programming\" \\n Prof. John Koza (Stanford University)\\n\\nThe genetic algorithm, an increasingly popular approach to highly \\nnon-linear multi-dimensional optimization problems, was originally \\ninspired by a biological metaphor.  This tutorial will cover both \\nthe biological motivations, and the actual implementation and \\ncharacteristics of the algorithm.  Genetic Programming, an \\nextension well-suited to problems where the discovery of the size \\nand shape of the solution is a major part of the problem, will \\nalso be addressed.  Particular attention will be paid to \\nbiological applications, and to identifying resources and software \\nthat will permit attendees to begin using the methods.  Dr. Koza, \\na Consulting Professor of Computer Science at Stanford, has taught \\nthis subject since 1988 and is the author of a standard text in \\nthe field.\\n\\n3:00-5:45pm \"Linguistic Methods in Sequence Analysis\" \\n Prof. David Searls (University of Pennsylvania) \\n & Shmuel Pietrokovski (Weizmann Institute)\\n\\nApproaches to sequence analysis based on linguistic methodologies \\nare increasingly in evidence.  These involve the adaptation of \\ntools and techniques from computational linguistics for syntactic \\npattern recognition and gene prediction, the classification of \\ngenetic structures and phenomena using formal language theory, the \\nidentification of significant vocabularies and overlapping codes \\nin sequence data, and sequence comparison reflecting taxonomic and \\nfunctional relatedness.  Dr. Searls, who holds research faculty \\nappointments in both Genetics and Computer Science at Penn, \\nrepresents the branch of this field that considers higher-order \\nsyntactic approaches to sequence data, while Shmuel Pietrokovski \\nhas studied and published with Prof. Edward Trifinov in the area \\nof word-based analyses.\\n\\n                      REGISTRATION FORM\\nMail, with check made out to \"ISMB-93\", to:\\n\\n               ISMB Conference, c/o J.

So far, when I ask, around here, I get the verses from\\nLeviticus spouted at me, but the whole rest of that book tends to be\\nignored by Christians (haven\\'t seen any stonings in a _long_ time :-).\\n\\nLater,\\nMax (Bob) Muir\\n\\n[The list was posted not long ago, as I recall, aside from Lev, commonly\\ncited passages are:\\n\\nthe story of Sodom.  Note however that this was a homosexual rape, and\\nthere\\'s no disagreement that that is wrong.  I take an intermediate\\nposition on this: note that Sodom is referred to elsewhere in the\\nBible for its sinfulness.  It doesn\\'t seem to have been known\\nspecifically for homosexuality.  Rather, I think it was considered a\\ncesspool of all sins. However from what we know of Jewish attitudes,\\nhomosexuality would have contributed to the horror of the action\\ndescribed.  (It almost seems to have been contrived to combine about\\nas many forms of evil in one act as possible: homosexual rape of\\nguests, who were actually angels.)  But this story is not specifically\\nabout homosexuality.\\n\\nIn the NT, the clear references are all from Paul\\'s letters.  In Rom\\n1, there is a passage that presupposes that homosexuality is an evil.\\nNote that the passage isn\\'t about homosexuality -- it\\'s about\\nidolatry.  Homosexuality is visited on people as a punishment, or at\\nleast result, of idolatry.  There are a number of arguments over this\\npassage.  It does not use the word \"homosexuality\", and it is referring\\nto people who are by nature heterosexual practicing homosexuality.\\nSo it\\'s not what I\\'d call an explicit teaching against all homosexuality.\\nBut it does seem to support what would be a natural assumption anyway,\\nthat Paul shares the general negative Jewish attitude towards \\nhomosexuality.\\n\\nThe other passages occur in lists of sins, in I Cor 6:9, and I Tim\\n1:10.  Unfortunately it\\'s not entirely clear what the words used here\\nmean.  There have been suggestions that one has a broader meaning,\\nsuch as \"wanton\", and that another may be specifically \"male\\nprostitute\".  Again, we don\\'t have here a precise teaching about\\nhomosexuality, but it is at least weak supportive evidence that Paul\\nshared the OT\\'s negative judgement on homosexuality.\\n\\nJude 1:7 is sometimes cited, however it\\'s probably not relevant.  The\\ncontext in Jude involves angels.  Since those who were almost raped in\\nSodom were angels, it seems likely that \"strange flesh\" refers to\\nintercourse with angels.\\n\\nAs you can see, the NT evidence is such that people\\'s conclusion is\\ndetermined by their approach to the Bible.  Conservatives note that\\nthe passages from Paul\\'s letters imply that he accepted the OT\\nprohibition.  This is enough for them to regard it as having NT\\nendorsement.  Liberals note that there\\'s no specific teaching, and no\\nclear definition of what is being prohibited or why (is the concern in\\nRom 1 the connection of homosexuality to pagan worship?  what exactly\\ndo the words in the lists of sins mean?).  Thus some believe it is\\nlegitimate to regard this as a attitude Paul took with him from his\\nbackground and not a specific teaching of the Gospel.\\n\\nThis is an explosive topic, which tends to result in long\\ndissertations on the exact meaning of various Greek words.  But it\\'s\\nclear to me that that\\'s mostly irrelevant.

Four Arab nations refused to\\n    grant them asylum.  Then when Israli Arabs agreed to take the\\n    responsibility for them, they were allowed into Israel.  Yes,\\n    Israel.  But when the plane landed, the Israeli Arabs who had\\n    previously agreed to take care of them refused to be involved\\n    with the rescue project, because they felt that it would make\\n    Israel look good.  It was more important to avoid any good PR\\n    for Israel than to take care of fellow Muslims.  Israel moved\\n    them to a kibbutz, where they are safe and secure.  The truth\\n    is that time after time the Islamic world has turned its back\\n    on Muslims in need more than Israel has.  Even in the case of\\n    the 400 deportees, Lebanon was willing to let their so-called\\n    Arab brothers freeze to death rather than give them sanctuary\\n    in Lebanon.  \\n\\n    Nearly twice as many Palestinians have been murdered by other\\n    Palestinians than in confrontations with Israel.  Hundreds of\\n    thousands of Palestinians had been deported from Kuwait, just\\n    because they were Palestinian.  The truth is that your phoney\\n    concern for the welfare of the Palestinians is nothing but an\\n    excuse to attack Israel.  You are part of the ignorant effort\\n    to confine all concern for the welfare of the Palestinians to\\n    attacking Israel.  But the truth is there are greater reasons\\n    than Israel for the plight of the Palestinians.  To disregard\\n    Jordan or Kuwait or Saudi Arabia or any of the other oil-rich \\n    nations who do nothing for these people, is to use the plight \\n    of these poor people as a vehicle for your hatred of Jews, or\\n    your hatred of Israel.  Anti-semitism and anti-Zionism is NOT\\n    the same as pro-Palestinian and anyone who insists that it is\\n    the same really does not give two hoots for their welfare.\\n\\n\\n\\n    Your pathetic analogy is so absent of relevant fact that your\\n    racism cannot be disguised.  Jews had never declared war on a\\n    Polish people.  Jews had never attacked Poles with knives, or\\n    had used the Ghetto as a staging ground for attacks.  To take\\n    something like the Warsaw Ghetto(the creation of which you do\\n    not even bother to discuss!)and the uprising that followed is\\n    to degrade the dead, and to show that intelligent debate on a \\n    difficult situation is beyond your intellectual purview.  You\\n    clearly have never even read a single word of the Covenant of \\n    the Islamic Resistance Movement.  Here is arguably the single\\n    most anti-semitic genocidal document since Mein Kampf, yet it\\n    is totally disregarded in your rantings.

Why are you indifferent to the death\\n    and suffering of people?  Why do you not care that these folk\\n    are being exterminated?  Why do you not care that only Israel\\n    has given any of these people safe haven?  Could it be due to \\n    the fact that it is not Israel who is doing the killing?  The\\n    people in Gaza are not being exterminated.  They aren't being\\n    killed.  They aren't being raped.  They aren't being starved.\\n    They aren't being driven from their lands.

Hamas figures\\nsignificantly in the Middle East equation. In December, Israel\\ndeported more than 400 Palestinians to Lebanon in response to\\nHamas\\'s kidnapping and execution of an Israeli soldier. A longer\\nversion appears in the May issue of Harper\\'s Magazine, which\\nobtained and translated the tape.)\\n \\n     My name is Yasir Hammad al-Hassan Ali. I live in Nuseirat [a\\nrefugee camp in the Gaza Strip]. I was born in 1964. I finished\\nhigh school, then attended Gaza Polytechnic. Later, I went to work\\nfor Islamic University in Gaza as a clerk. I\\'m married and I have\\ntwo daughters.\\n     The Qassam Battalions are the only group in Palestine\\nexplicitly dedicated to jihad [holy war]. Our primary concern is\\nPalestinians who collaborate with the enemy. Many young men and\\nwomen have fallen prey to the cunning traps laid by the [Israeli]\\nSecurity Services.\\n     Since our enemies are trying to obliterate our nation,\\ncooperation with them is clearly a terrible crime. Our most\\nimportant objective must be to put an end to the plague of\\ncollaboration. To do so, we abduct collaborators, intimidate and\\ninterrogate them in order to uncover other collaborators and expose\\nthe methods that the enemy uses to lure Palestinians into\\ncollaboration in the first place. In addition to that, naturally,\\nwe confront the problem of collaborators by executing them.\\n     We don\\'t execute every collaborator. After all, about 70\\npercent of them are innocent victims, tricked or black-mailed into\\ntheir misdeeds. The decision whether to execute a collaborator is\\nbased on the seriousness of his crimes. If, like many\\ncollaborators, he has been recruited as an agent of the Israeli\\nBorder Guard then it is imperative that he be executed at once.\\nHe\\'s as dangerous as an Israeli soldier, so we treat him like an\\nIsraeli soldier.\\n     There\\'s another group of collaborators who perform an even\\nmore loathsome role -- the ones who help the enemy trap young men\\nand women in blackmail schemes that force them to become\\ncollaborators. I regard the \"isqat\" [the process by which a\\nPalestinians is blackmailed into collaboration] of single person as\\ngreater crime than the killing of a demonstrator. If someone is\\nguilty of causing repeated cases of isqat, than it is our religious\\nduty to execute him.\\n     A third group of collaborators is responsible for the\\ndistribution of narcotics. They work on direct orders from the\\nSecurity Services to distribute drugs as widely as possible. Their\\nvictims become addicted and soon find it unbearable to quit and\\nimpossible to afford more. They collaborate in order to get the\\ndrugs they crave. The dealers must also be executed.\\n     In the battalions, we have developed a very careful method of\\nuncovering collaborators, We can\\'t afford to abduct an innocent\\nperson, because once we seize a person his reputation is tarnished\\nforever. We will abduct and interrogate a collaborator only after\\nevidence of his guilt has been established -- never before. If\\nafter interrogation the collaborator is found guilty beyond any\\ndoubt, then he is executed.\\n     In many cases, we don\\'t have to make our evidence against\\ncollaborators public, because everyone knows that they\\'re guilty.\\nBut when the public isn\\'t aware that a certain individual is a\\ncollaborator, and we accuse him, people are bound to ask for\\nevidence. Many people will proclaim his innocence, so there must be\\nirrefutable proof before he is executed. This proof is usually\\nobtained in the form of a confession.\\n     At first, every collaborator denies his crimes. So we start\\noff by showing the collaborator the testimony against him. We tell\\nhim that he still has a chance to serve his people, even in the\\nlast moment of his life, by confessing and giving us the\\ninformation we need.\\n     We say that we know his repentance in sincere and that he has\\nbeen a victim. That kind of talk is convincing. Most of them\\nconfess after that. Others hold out; in those cases, we apply\\npressure, both psychological and physical. Then the holdouts\\nconfess as well.\\n     Only one collaborator has ever been executed without an\\ninterrogation. In that case, the collaborator had been seen working\\nfor the Border Guard since before the intifada, and he himself\\nconfessed his involvement to a friend, who disclosed the\\ninformation to us. In addition, three members of his network of\\ncollaborators told us that he had caused their isqat. With this\\nmuch evidence, there was no need to interrogate him. But we are\\nvery careful to avoid wrongful executions. In every case, our\\nprincipal is the same: the accused should be interrogated until he\\nhimself confesses his crimes. \\n     A few weeks ago, we sat down and complied a list of\\ncollaborators to decide whether there were any who could be\\nexecuted without interrogation. An although we had hundreds of\\nnames, still, because of our fear of God and of hell, we could not\\nmark any of these men, except for the one I just mentioned, for\\nexecution.\\n     When we execute a collaborator in public, we use a gun. But\\nafter we abduct and interrogate a collaborator, we can\\'t shoot him\\n-- to do so might give away our locations. That\\'s why collaborators\\nare strangled.

The reason is\\nthat deuterium does not have exactly the same reaction rates as\\nhydrogen due to its extra mass (which causes lower velocity, Boltzman\\nconstant, mumble).  This throws various bits of body biochemistry out\\nof kilter, and you get sick and die.\\n\\nI\\'ve never heard of anyone being poisened this way, in or out of real\\nlife.  The process takes quite a while.  If anyone wants to write this\\nbook, I would imagine you would have to:\\n\\n1: Replace a significant fraction of the water in the body with heavy\\n   water.\\n\\n2: Wait while normal breakdown and repair processes cause other\\n   molecules in the body to be synthesised using the deuterium.\\n\\nDuring this process the victim would gradually deteriorate and\\neventually die, but I imagine it would take weeks during which the\\npoisoner would have to ensure that a significant proportion of the\\nwater the victim ingested was heavy.\\n\\nYou would get such a mess of symptoms that the doctors would be both\\nalarmed and confused.  Why should every organ in the body suddenly\\nbegin to deteriorate?  If you can figure out how the poisoner gets the\\nheavy water into the victim in a hospital then you could have a real\\nstory here.\\n\\nCome to think of it, &lt;2&gt; would continue even after the heavy water was\\nno longer being ingested, so hospitalisation might be too late.\\n\\nThe most detectable effect would be that the victim\\'s body fluids\\nwould literally be \"heavy\".  Water has a molecular weight of 18 and\\nheavy water has a MW of 20.  Thus the victim\\'s weight will increase by\\nabout 1% for every 10% of body water replaced by heavy water.

I don\\'t know anyone with a bike who could \\nteach me, and the most advice I\\'ve heard is either \"do you live near a\\nfield\" or \"do you have a friend with a pickup truck\", the answers to both\\nof which are NO.  Do I just ride around my neighborhood and hope for \\nthe best?  I kind of live in a residential area but it\\'s not suburbs.\\nIt\\'s still the big city and I\\'m about a mile from downtown so that \\ndoesn\\'t seem too viable.

Perhaps they were \"strong in\\nthe faith?\"\\n\\n---------------------------\\n\\n[No, I don\\'t believe that Paul can overrule God.  However Paul was\\nwriting for a largely Gentile audience.  The Law was regarded by Jews\\nat the time (and now) as binding on Jews, but not on Gentiles.  There\\nare rules that were binding on all human beings (the so-called Noachic\\nlaws), but they are quite minimal.  The issue that the Church had to\\nface after Jesus\\' death was what to do about Gentiles who wanted to\\nfollow Christ.  The decision not to impose the Law on them didn\\'t say\\nthat the Law was abolished.  It simply acknowledged that fact that it\\ndidn\\'t apply to Gentiles.  Thus there is no contradiction with Mat 5.\\nAs far as I can tell, both Paul and other Jewish Christians did\\ncontinue to participate in Jewish worship on the Sabbath.  Thus they\\ncontinued to obey the Law.  The issue was (and is) with Gentile\\nChristians, who are not covered by the Law (or at least not by the\\nceremonial aspects of it).\\n\\nJesus dealt mostly with Jews.  I think we can reasonably assume that\\nMat 5 was directed to a Jewish audience.  He did interact with\\nGentiles a few times (e.g. the centurion whose slave was healed and a\\ncouple of others).  The terms used to describe the centurion (see Luke\\n7) suggest that he was a \"God-fearer\", i.e. a Gentile who followed\\nGod, but had not adopted the whole Jewish Law.  He was commended by\\nJewish elders as a worthy person, and Jesus accepted him as such.\\nThis seems to me to indicate that Jesus accepted the prevailing view\\nthat Gentiles need not accept the Law.\\n\\nHowever there\\'s more involved if you want to compare Jesus and Paul on\\nthe Law.  In order to get a full picture of the role of the Law, we\\nhave to come to grips with Paul\\'s apparent rejection of the Law, and\\nhow that relates to Jesus\\' commendation of the Law.  At least as I\\nread Paul, he says that the Law serves a purpose that has been in a\\ncertain sense superceded.  Again, this issue isn\\'t one of the\\nabolition of the Law.  In the middle of his discussion, Paul notes\\nthat he might be understood this way, and assures us that that\\'s not\\nwhat he intends to say.  Rather, he sees the Law as primarily being\\npresent to convict people of their sinfulness.  But ultimately it\\'s an\\nimpossible standard, and one that has been superceded by Christ.\\nPaul\\'s comments are not the world\\'s clearest here, and not everyone\\nagrees with my reading.  But the interesting thing to notice is that\\neven this radical position does not entail an abolition of the Law.\\nIt still remains as an uncompromising standard, from which not an iota\\nor dot may be removed.  For its purpose of convicting of sin, it\\'s\\nimportant that it not be relaxed.  However for Christians, it\\'s not\\nthe end -- ultimately we live in faith, not Law.\\n\\nWhile the theoretical categories they use are rather different, in the\\nend I think Jesus and Paul come to a rather similar conclusion.  The\\nquoted passage from Mat 5 should be taken in the context of the rest\\nof the Sermon on the Mount, where Jesus shows us how he interprets the\\nLaw.  The \"not an iota or dot\" would suggest a rather literal reading,\\nbut in fact that\\'s not Jesus\\' approach.  Jesus\\' interpretations\\nemphasize the intent of the Law, and stay away from the ceremonial\\ndetails.  Indeed he is well known for taking a rather free attitude\\ntowards the Sabbath and kosher laws.  Some scholars claim that Mat\\n5:17-20 needs to be taken in the context of 1st Cent. Jewish\\ndiscussions.  Jesus accuses his opponents of caring about giving a\\ntenth of even the most minor herbs, but neglecting the things that\\nreally matter: justice, mercy and faith, and caring about how cups and\\nplates are cleaned, but not about the fact that inside the people who\\nuse them are full of extortion and rapacity.  (Mat 23:23-25) This, and\\nthe discussion later in Mat 5, suggest that Jesus has a very specific\\nview of the Law in mind, and that when he talks about maintaining the\\nLaw in its full strength, he is thinking of these aspects of it.\\nPaul\\'s conclusion is similar.  While he talks about the Law being\\nsuperceded, all of the specific examples he gives involve the\\n\"ceremonial law\", such as circumcision and the Sabbath.  He is quite\\nconcerned about maintaining moral standards.\\n\\nThe net result of this is that when Paul talks about the Law being\\nsuperceded, and Jesus talks about the Law being maintained, I believe\\nthey are talking about different aspects of the Law.  Paul is\\nembroiled in arguments about circumcision.  As is natural in letters\\nresponding to specific situations, he\\'s looking at the aspect of the\\nLaw that is currently causing trouble: the Law as specifically Jewish\\nceremonies.  He certainly does not intend to abolish divine standards\\nof conduct.  On the other hand, when Jesus commends the Law, he seems\\nto be talking the Law in its broadest implications for morals and\\nhuman relationships, and deemphasizing those aspects that were later\\nto give Paul so much trouble.\\n\\nIt\\'s unfortunate that people use the same terms in different ways, but\\nwe should be familiar with that from current conflicts.  Look at the\\nway terms like \"family values\" take on special meaning from the\\ncurrent context.  Imagine some poor historian of the future trying to\\nfigure out why \"family values\" should be used as a code word for\\nopposition to homosexuality in one specific period in the U.S.  I\\nthink Law had taken on a similar role in the arguments Paul was\\ninvolved in.  Paul was clearly not rejecting all of the Jewish values\\nthat go along with the term \"Law\", any more than people who concerned\\nabout the \"family values\" movement are really opposed to family\\nvalues.',\n  '\\n\\nI think the is BZ gas, not CS or CN.

Others (like me) are more\\n     sensitive and get fairly large swollen sore-like affairs.\\n\\n  2. Chigger bites are the gift that keeps on giving.  I swear\\n     that these things will itch for months.\\n\\n  3. There is a lot of folklore about chiggers.  I think most of\\n     it is fiction.  I have tried to do research on the critters,\\n     since they have such an effect on me.  The only book I could\\n     find on the subject was a *single* book in UNC\\'s special\\n     collections library.  I have not yet gone through what is\\n     required to get it.\\n\\n  4. Based on my experience and that of my family members, the old\\n     folk remedy of fingernail polish simply doesn\\'t work.  I recall\\n     reading that the theory upon which it is based (that the chiggers\\n     burrow into your skin and continue to party there) is false.  I\\n     think it is more likely that the reaction is to toxins of some\\n     sort the little pests release.  But this is speculation.\\n\\n  5. The *best* approach is prevention.  A couple of things work well.\\n     A good insect repellent (DEET) such as Deep Woods Off liberally\\n     applied to ankles, waistband, etc. is a good start.  There is\\n     another preparation called \"Chig Away\" that is a combination of\\n     sulfur and some kind of cream (cortisone?) that originally was\\n     prepared for the Army and is not commercially available.  In\\n     the summer I put this on my ankles every morning when I get\\n     up on weekends since I literally can\\'t go outside where we\\n     live (in the country) without serious consequences.  (They\\n     apparently don\\'t like sulfur much at all.  You can use sulfur\\n     as a dust on your body or clothing to repel them.)\\n\\n  6. No amount of prevention will be *completely* successful.  Forget\\n     the fingernail polish.  I have finally settled upon a treatment\\n     that involves topical application of a combination of cortisone\\n     creme (reduces the inflamation and swelling) and benzocaine\\n     (relieves the itch).  I won\\'t tell you all the things I\\'ve tried.\\n     Nor will I tell you some of the things my wife does since this\\n     counts as minor surgery and is best not mentioned (I also think\\n     it gains nothing).\\n\\n  7. The swelling and itching can also be significantly relieved\\n     by the application of hot packs, and this seems to speed recovery\\n     as well.\\n\\nDoctors seem not to care much about chiggers.

Dogs are social\\nbeasts, and recognize a domination/submission hierarchy.  To a dog, there are\\ntwo types of fellow-creatures; that which he dominates, and that which\\ndominate him.  You need to unambiguously represent yourself as being of the\\nlatter class.

Well, first, it's a good idea to\\nassume that most dogs who chase motorcycles do so because they think it's a\\ngame, and not out of overt hostility.  The MSF suggestion is a very good one;\\nwhen you see the dog coming, slow down so he determines a particular place of\\ninterception.  Just before you (and he) reach that spot, punch the throttle so\\nthat when he reaches it you're already long gone.  Dogs take a few seconds to\\nreact to new input, and definitely cannot comprehend the acceleration that a\\nmotorcycle is capable of.\\n\\nWith a hostile dog, or one which you repeatedly encounter, stronger measures\\nmay be necessary.  This is the face off.  First -- and there is very important\\n-- make sure you NEVER face off a dog on his territory.  Face him off on the\\nroad, not on his driveway.  If necessary, have a large stick, rolled up\\nnewspaper, etc. (something the beast will understand is something that will\\nhurt him).  Stand your ground, then slowly advance.  Your mental attitude is\\nthat you are VERY ANGRY and are going to dispense TERRIBLE PUNISHMENT.  The\\nlarger the dog, the greater your anger.\\n\\nDogs will pick up anger, just as they can pick up fear.  And, since you and he\\nare not on his home territory, it may suddenly dawn on the dog that perhaps he\\nis on your territory, and that you are prepared to fight to the death.\\n\\nMost dogs will decide that it is a good idea to retreat to their own territory\\nwhere there is at least a home advantage.

What modulation scheme do these Clipper boxes use?\\nIs it possible to record the tones for use after the keys are obtained?\\nI thought it was quite difficult to record a modem session at some\\nintermediate point on the line. Maybe they have taken a crash course\\nin data comms and have a unit that demodulates the tones and stores the\\ndigital stream for decryption later. This would still suffer from the\\nsame problems as trying to record the tones as the demodulator would not\\nbe at one end of the line. If calls can't be recorded for decryption later\\nit would be quite easy to foil the system by buying lots of Clipper units\\n(these are supposed to be cheap mass market items) and using them in turn.\\n\\nHow tolerant is the modulation scheme to errors? These things are proposed\\nfor use by US corporations to secure their foreign offices, where phone\\nline quality may well be poor. It seems hard enough to me to get digitised\\nspeech of any quality into something a modem can handle without having to\\nadd lots of error correction to keep the decryption in sync.\\n\\n\\nThis raises an intersting question in the UK. Here it is illegal to connect\\nanything to a public telecomms network without it being approved by a body\\ncalled BABT. It has been stated, either here or in the uk.telecom group,\\nthat they will not approve equipment that does encryption. I don't know\\nif this is true or not, but this would make a good test case.\\nPerhaps `friendly' countries, and the UK may still qualify, will get\\nto fish in the escrowed key pool as well.\\n\",\n  'Mr. Freeman:\\n\\nPlease find something more constructive to do with your time rather\\nthan engaging in fantasy.....

Well, who cares.\\n\\nFirst let me try to work out the facts that we get to know about the\\nClipper-Chip, from what Hellman and Denning were able to tell us:\\n\\nThe chip itself is not confined to (digital) telephony, but performs\\ngeneral encryption in a symmetric manner.  The chip supports CFB OFB\\nECB (and whatever the fourth mode of operation for DES is), the algorithm\\nconsists of 32 rounds of *whatever*, and takes 80-Bit keys. Input data\\nseems to be 64 Bit? Yes.\\nSo if two people want secure communication (whatever that means when \\nClipper is involved) they have first to agree on ONE secret key. \\n(Or is it one key per direction ?)\\nThey can exchange this key via DH-schemes or however.\\nSomehow the two feed their so won secret key into the Clipper-chip\\nwhich is now ready to work.\\nThe clipper chip carries an unique Serial-Number (30 Bit's), and 160 Key-Bits.\\nThese 160 key-bits seem to have been gained by encrypting the serial-number\\nwith 160 seed-bits. (The seed-bits seem not to be stored in the chip)\\nAt beginning of communication (and perhaps at certain invtervals whithin??)\\nbefore sending the fist real 64-bit output of the first encryption the Clipper\\nchip put's out packets (I guess 3) which represent the serial number,\\nand the session key. This might look like\\nX{ E[K; chipkeyK1+K2], serial number}\\nwhere X is a transformation of these 3? Packets involving a family-key.\\nThis family(sp?)-key is equal for ALL chips. (X might be a simple XOR ???)\\nAfter that, the (digital?) phone-call can be done as usual, every packet\\nbeing encrypted and decrypted by Clipper.\\n\\nDenning describes how K1 and K2 shall be generated, using a seed of 160\\nBit's.\\n\\nNow, leaving alone politics, which does not concern me as much as you, not\\nbeing an American Citicien(tm) [ :-) ] , there are some weak points in this\\nscheme, which might be exploited by several parties.\\n\\nAs far as I know about the generation of K1,K2 ; S1 and S2 look like the \\nobvious backdoor. They could be used to generate the chip-keys by knowing\\nthe serial-number (and also the family-key) of the chip. I really can't\\nimagine why these seeds would be needed otherwise, as true random-sources\\nfor the generation of the K1,K2 can be bought for not to much money.\\n\\nThen, the escrows. Each of them will get 80 bit of a 160-Bit key. Security\\ncould (as little as existant) be maximized by giving them 160-bits\\neach, which have to be xored together to give the K1,K2. Now let's simply\\nassume the escrows are trustworthy, and can't be fooled by criminals or\\nlaw enforchemnt agencies. (And there will be no quarrel between escrows\\nand l.e.a which would hinder the l.e.a in doing their duties, and so on\\nand so on) Once the keys are surrendered, the corresponding\\nchip is compromised forever. Not very clever, IMHO [ :-)) ].\\nHow about sending in the encrypted session-keys for each phone-call that\\nthe police (or whoever) want's to listen to? Escrows could then simply decode\\nthis session-key and send it back to police. (And would naturally not do this\\nafter the warrant has expired...) This would be a better technical solution,\\nbut I guess politics will not work that way.\\n\\nApparently (as Miss Dennings stated) the only one performing actually decodes\\nof intercepted messages shall be the FBI. Great. So local guys can not inter-\\ncept (understand) your traffic anymore. Does this mean that the FBI monopolizes\\nthe right to do legal wiretaps ? (How is law over there, I have no idea who\\nis allowed to tap, and who not) This certainly means that watched communi-\\ncations will be routed automatically from the service-providing company\\nto the FBI, if the communicaiton is a watched one. And this means as far\\nas I understand it that the family-key has to be known by each switching-\\ncompany, and those providing cellular-phone servies etcetc. So the family-key\\nwill not be very secret, and thus serial-numbers of calls will be readable\\nby anybody who cares. I _like_ traffic-analysis!\\n\\nWhat do you guess, what happens, if you use the chip in ECB mode, and the\\nfirst few packets of the chip are somehow lost or garbled? So the session\\nkey would not be actually broadcasted over the line? Hmmm. Shouldn't be so\\ndifficult to do *that* :^)\\n\\nAnd now a last point, for the other side.

Kellner had traveled widely in the East, where he\\nmet three adepts who instructed him specific magical practices.  \\nKellner\\'s efforts to develop the Order were later assisted by Franz\\nHartmann, Heinrich Klein and Theodore Reuss, who had worked together\\nprior to joining the O.T.O.  The Order was first proclaimed in 1902\\nin Reuss\\'s Masonic publication, \\'Oriflamme\\'.  On Kellner\\'s death,\\nReuss succeeded him as Outer Head [O.H.O.].  The \\'Jubilee\\' edition of\\nthe \\'Oriflamme\\', published in 1912, announced that the Order taught\\nsecret of sexual magic.\\n \\n\"Theodore Reuss was an interesting character.  Born June 28, 1855 in\\nAugsburg, he entered Masonry in 1876.  He was a singer, journalist and\\npossibly a spy for the Prussian political police, infiltrating the Socialist\\nLeague founded by Karl Marx\\'s daughter and her husband.  Reuss was\\nlater associated with William Wynn Westcott, a leader of the Golden\\nDawn, who later introduced him to John Yarker.  Yarker chartered Reuss to\\nfound the Rites of Memphis and Mizraim in Germany.  After several\\nattempts to concretize various Masonic Rites, Reuss settled on the\\ndevelopment of the O.T.O.\\n\\n\"The Order experienced reasonably steady growth under Reuss\\' leadership.\\nFor example, he chartered Papus in France, Rudolph Steiner in Berlin\\nand H. Spencer Lewis in the USA.  In 1912, the historic meeting between\\nReuss and Crowley occurred.  Crowley wrote that Reuss came to him and\\naccused him of revealing Order secrets.  When Crowley looked at it afresh,\\nthe initiated interpretation of sexual magick unfolded itself to him for\\nthe first time.  Reuss appointed Crowley as Supreme and Holy King of all\\nthe English speaking world, and it was this authorization that he invoked\\nwhen publishing the material of the Equinox.\\n\\n\"Reuss resigned as Outer Head of the Order in 1922 after suffering a\\nstroke and named Crowley his successor.  All was well until 1925 when\\n_The Book of the Law_ was translated into German.  There was a break\\nin the continuity of the Order.  Manyk members split with the new O.H.O.\\nover the book, which Crowley was actively promulgating through the Order.\\nHe had earlier revise dthe Order rituals at Reuss\\'s request, deeply\\ninfusing the doctrines of the New Aeon revelation.\"\\n\\n_An Introduction to the History of the O.T.O._, by Ad Veritatem IX\\'\\n\\nWithin _Equinox III:10_, Edited by \\n  Hymenaeus Beta, Frater Superior, Rex Summus Sanctissimus,\\n    Caliph of the United States of America,\\n      Published by Samuel Weiser, 1990.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere are many possible reasons that our Frater Superior included this\\nmaterial in _Equinox III:10_.  And this is the real point, is it not?\\nWhy did he wish to publish such things about the history of his own\\norganization?  Does he represent a dogmatic threat to the principle\\nof Thelema?  Or is he exercising his True Will and putting forth very\\ncomplex pictures with no easy answers?  A picture which leaves room\\nfor very many interpretations.\\n\\nIt is quite easy for me to see, for example, that all of O.T.O. derived\\nout of the dribble of faltering Masonry, purchased by clever hucksters\\nwith an ounce of courage and some writing ability to aid them.  And I\\ncan take that all the way down to our present Caliph, whose feeble\\nsupport of the \\'Law of Thelema\\' is laughable at best.\\n\\nWould I be thrown out of the Order for speaking in this way?  \\nWill I?  \\nI think not.\\nWhy?  Because my Frater will see it as a perspective, an interjection\\nI am using as an example.  My illustration shows that we may express things\\nin the context of a larger work and the true significance of this may be\\nquite difficult to apprehend at first.\\n\\nSo it may be with OTO and Merlinus X\\'.  Please look O.T.O. more carefully.\\nI do not support Reuss\\'s words myself, as I am not qualified to assess\\nthem, and I am critical of their pomposity.  If I who am a member of\\nthe Order take such a stand and am allowed to continue doing so, then\\nwhat can this say about the health of the Order?  Does it mean that\\nthe Order has \\'gone soft\\' and abandoned its moral principles?  Or\\ndoes it mean that it is strong in its ability to let the will of\\nuniversal kinship arise on its own, not shackled by some dogmatic\\nrequirement?  How shall we resolve these two possibilities?\\n\\n\\nI find a high calibre of individual associated with Ordo Templi Orientis.\\nThey are often quite intelligent and sometimes very well versed in arcane\\nor usual information.  They are quite often artists and geniuses.  \\nHaving met some 20 longstanding members in the SF Bay Area (many who are or\\nwere very heavily involved with the Order), I can vouch for the integrity\\nof the organization as it stands.\\n\\nI have sometimes questioned the policy of Hymenaeus Beta.  In these moments \\nI followed my intuition, and I\\'ve found little to stop me from requesting\\na Second initiation from a different O.T.O. body.  I\\'m happily participating\\nin social groups (Feasts or Initiations) and have come to know the Gnostic\\nMass well enough for my tastes.\\n \\n\\nThis doesn\\'t make me an authority on Order politics and explanations, however.\\nI can only hypothesize and relay to you what I understand based on my\\nlimited contact with other members.\\n\\nI urge you not to take the words of Merlinus X too far.  There are many\\nways to interpret words, and many people who have become involved with\\nthe Order feel very strongly about the sanctity of personal freedom\\nand the preservation of individual vision.\\n\\nI welcome other comment on this issue and will be writing more in response\\nto other posts in this thread.\\n\\n\\nInvoke me under my stars.

On returning to Georgia Tech, he showed\\na transparency of atmospheric cooling rates according to the year they\\nwere generated by the models.  There was an unmistakable correlation\\nbetween the age (meaning simplicity of assumptions; i.e., remoteness\\nfrom reality) of each model and the degree of cooling.  Whereas Sagan's\\nmodel showed an approximate 40-degree cooling episode, the next model \\nin sophistication showed about half that, and so on until we got to\\nour boy's model, which showed a 1-2 degree drop if the war happened in\\nthe winter and less than a 10 degree drop if it happened in the summer.\\nHe predicted that when we would include the presence of oceans, chemistry,\\nthe biosphere, and other indicators of reality in the models, we would\\nprobably see even less cooling.

Shaw  chairs the undergraduate  interdepartmental degree\\nprogram in Near Eastern Studies and has organized the Program for\\nthe Study of Ottoman and Turkish Jewry. He is affiliated with the\\nG. E. von Grunebaum Center for Near Eastern Studies.\\n\\nEditor: How did  you come to write these two  books on Turkey and\\nEuropean and Turkish Jews?\\n\\nShaw: Basically, I\\'m  an Ottoman historian, but  I\\'m also Jewish.\\nI\\'ve  spent twenty-five  years studying  Ottoman history,  and as\\ntime went along, whenever I  found materials on the Ottoman Jews,\\nI collected  them. But  I never  did anything  with them  until a\\ncouple of years  ago, when I suddenly realized that  1992 was the\\n500th  anniversary of  the  Jews being  expelled  from Spain  and\\ncoming  to Turkey.  Then the  Sephardic Temple  down on  Wilshire\\nAvenue invited me  to give a series of three  lectures on Ottoman\\nJewry.  These lectures  were  greatly appreciated,  and I  became\\nmotivated to  undertake further research  to develop a  book, The\\nJews of the  Ottoman Empire and the Turkish)  Republic. This book\\nis quite different from the  works of most Jewish historians, who\\ntend to look  at the Jews in any country  more from the viewpoint\\nof the Jews  and the Jewish community, and rely  mainly on Jewish\\nsources.  I  view my  subject  as  an  Ottoman historian,  and  I\\napproach the Jews of the Ottoman Empire largely from the point of\\nview of Ottoman  society, using largely Ottoman  sources. After I\\nfinished  this book  and  sent it  to the  press,  I came  across\\nadditional documents  relating to  Turkish Jews during  World War\\nII. In the completed book, I had said that Turkey had done a good\\ndeal  to rescue  the Jews  during  World War  II, but  I did  not\\nactually have many details. Then I  found a batch of documents in\\nthe Foreign Ministry archive relating to actions taken by Turkish\\ndiplomats to  help the Jews  before and during the  Holocaust. It\\nwas too late to add this new information to the book in press, so\\nI decided to  write a second book. I  conducted further research,\\nmainly in the archives of the  Foreign Ministry in Ankara and the\\nTurkish Embassy and Consulate in Paris. The result was the second\\nbook, Turkey and  the Holocaust, which details  how Turkey helped\\nrescue Jews from the Nazis.\\n\\n- How exactly did they do this?\\n\\nThe story takes  place over a number of years.  The book presents\\nthe material in three parts, first of which deals with the period\\nbefore the Holocaust. When the Nazis  came to power in Germany in\\n1933,  they immediately  started  dismissing  Jews and  anti-Nazi\\nGermans from universities,  hospitals, scientific institutes, and\\nthe like. Turkey at that moment was just beginning the process of\\nreforming its  universities, and it  saw in these Jews,  who were\\nbeing fired from their positions in Germany, a good source of new\\ntalent to  help modernize the Turkish  universities. Within three\\nmonths  after the  Nazis  started dismissing  these Jews,  Turkey\\narranged to take many of them in. They were brought to Turkey and\\nwere   given   appointments   as  professors   in   the   Turkish\\nuniversities, as  heads of scientific institutes,  and as medical\\npersonnel in hospitals. About 300  to 500 major Jewish professors\\ncame to  Turkey in  the 1930s. Ernst  Reuter, a  German political\\nscientist,  spent the  war  years teaching  political science  in\\nTurkey. After  World War II,  he was  mayor of Berlin  during the\\nBerlin Airlift.  Fritz Neimark, a major  German Jewish economist,\\ncame to Turkey and helped  establish a modern school of economics\\nin Istanbul.  A man named  Reichenbach, who was rescued  from the\\nNazis by  Turkey and  spent the war  years in  Turkey, eventually\\ncame to  UCLA, where he  became a professor of  philosophy. Other\\nGerman Jewish  emigres engaged in cultural  activities in Turkey.\\nOne  such was  Karl  Ebert,  who had  been  a leading  theatrical\\nproducer in Berlin until he was expelled by the Nazis. He went to\\nTurkey, where he  organized the Turkish National  Theater and the\\nTurkish National Opera  Company in Ankara, with the  help of Paul\\nHindemuth. So  the first  section of the  book covers  this first\\nphase, when Jews were being  persecuted in Germany and rescued by\\nTurkey.  Oddly enough,  the  German emigres,  when  they were  in\\nTurkey, did not seem to think too badly of Germany. They regarded\\nthemselves more  as Germans than Jews,  and they did not  join in\\nthe anti-Nazi activities of the local Turkish Jewish community. I\\neven  found  letters  from  the Nazi  representatives  to  Turkey\\npraising these German Jewish refugees for their work in promoting\\nthe idea  of German  culture. Even though  these people  had been\\npersecuted by the Nazis and rescued by the Turks, they shared the\\nNazis\\' feelings of  Aryan racial superiority over  the Turks. The\\nsecond part of the book deals  with the Holocaust, which began in\\n1940 when the Nazis occupied France.  In Europe at that time, and\\nespecially in France, there were  about 20,000 Turkish Jews. They\\nhad migrated to Europe for various reasons from about the turn of\\nthe century onward. Most of them had settled in Europe during the\\nTurkish war for  independence after World War I,  when Greece was\\nthreatening to overrun Turkey. The Greeks had persecuted the Jews\\nthroughout the nineteenth century, and the Jews feared what might\\nhappen to them if the Greeks  took over in Turkey. Many Jews fled\\nto France during  the 1920s and 1930s. Many  also abandoned their\\nTurkish  citizenship and  became  French  citizens. Suddenly  the\\nNazis invaded France in 1940 and started introducing all sorts of\\nanti-Jewish laws.  The Turkish  Jews soon found  that it  was not\\nworth very much to  be a French Jew, but that it  was worth a lot\\nto be a Turkish Jew.\\n\\n- How so?\\n\\nTurkey remained neutral through most of World War II. It retained\\nits embassies  and consulates in all  the Nazi-occupied countries\\nuntil it finally entered the war on the side of the Allies at the\\nend of 1944. During the war,  therefore, Turkey was in a position\\nto  defend its  citizens  against anti-Jewish  measures, and  the\\nactions that  Turkish diplomats took  form the second  chapter of\\nthe  book. Turkish  diplomats  who were  stationed  in France  in\\nparticular intervened to protect Jews of Turkish citizenship from\\nthe Nazis. For those Turkish  Jews who had retained their Turkish\\ncitizenship,  there  was  generally  no  problem.  If  they  were\\narrested and sent to a  concentration camp, the Turkish diplomats\\nwould  communicate with  the  commanders of  the  camp and  other\\nofficials and say in effect:  \"These people are Turkish citizens.\\nYou  can\\'t do  this  to  them.\" And  the  Turkish  Jews would  be\\nreleased.  If  their  businesses were  confiscated,  the  Turkish\\ndiplomats would protest and the businesses would be restored.\\n\\nThe Nazis  in general  wanted to keep  the friendship  of Turkey.\\nThey hoped to be able to use  Turkey as a gateway for an invasion\\nof the Middle  East, and they also wanted to  obtain chromium and\\nmanganese from Turkey. In order  to keep Turkish friendship, they\\nusually accepted  these interventions on behalf  of Turkish Jews.\\nThe Turkish  diplomats sometimes went to  the concentration camps\\nto secure the release of Turkish Jews. At times they even boarded\\ntrains hauling  Turkish Jews  to Auschwitz for  extermination and\\nsucceeded in getting them off the train. Most of the foreign Jews\\nwere sent  to a concentration  camp at  a place called  Drancy in\\nParis,  and that\\'s  where  most of  the  intercession by  Turkish\\nconsuls took place.\\n\\nThe greater problem came with  the Turkish Jews who had abandoned\\ntheir  Turkish citizenship  and had  become French  citizens. The\\nconsuls couldn\\'t declare that  these people were Turkish citizens\\nbecause  they were  not.  My book  includes  photographs of  Jews\\nlining  up in  front  of  the Turkish  consulate,  either to  get\\npassports to  return to Turkey or  to get a restoration  of their\\nTurkish  citizenship.   This  was   a  bureaucratic   matter,  so\\nprocessing the application would take  some time. In the meantime\\nit was a  real emergency, because the Nazis would  arrest Jews on\\nthe streets for almost nothing.  The Nazis would even arrest them\\nif they  had radios  or telephones  in their  apartments, because\\nradios and  telephones were  forbidden to Jews.  To take  care of\\nthese  former  Turkish Jews,  the  Turkish  diplomats invented  a\\ndocument called  gayri muntazem  vatandash, or  \"irregular fellow\\ncitizen.\" The  document said in  effect \"This person is  a former\\nTurkish  citizen  who has  applied  for  the restoration  of  his\\nTurkish citizenship.  In the meantime  we would appreciate  it if\\nyou  would treat  him  as  if he  were  a  Turkish citizen.\"  The\\ndiplomats wrote  the document in  Turkish and put their  seals on\\nit. Since  the Nazis could  not read  Turkish, on the  whole they\\naccepted  these papers  as certificates  of citizenship.  By this\\nmeans, the  Turkish diplomats were  able to rescue many  Jews who\\nhad relinquished their Turkish citizenship.\\n\\nActually the Nazis were of two minds about the Turkish defense of\\nJews. On the one hand the  Nazi Foreign Ministry, which wanted to\\nretain the friendship of Turkey,  was in favor of accepting these\\ninterventions. On the other hand, Himmler and Eichmann wanted all\\nJews exterminated.  At times  Himmler and  Eichmann were  able to\\nprevail and some  of the Turkish Jews were sent  off to Auschwitz\\nbefore the Turkish consuls could do anything.\\n\\n- Do you have statistics on how many Turkish Jews were rescued?\\n\\nThere were about  20,000 Turkish Jews in Europe  before world War\\nII,  about 10,000  of whom  were living  in France.  Most of  the\\ninformation in this section of  the book relates to the situation\\nin France. I have published  the letters that the Turkish consuls\\nsent to  the Nazi  officials and  the letters  that came  back in\\nreply. Generally the Nazis said  that if the Turkish consul would\\npresent  documents  certifying   that  arrested  individuals  are\\nTurkish citizens,  and promise  to send them  out of  France, the\\nNazis would release them from the concentration camp. The Turkish\\nconsuls also organized  special trains to take  Turkish Jews from\\nNazi-occupied  territory   back  to  Turkey.  These   trains  ran\\nregularly in 1943 and 1944. The Nazis gave the Turkish Jews visas\\nso they  could pass out  of Nazi  territory, but the  trains were\\noften  held  up by  the  Nazi-influenced  governments of  Eastern\\nEurope  -   Croatia,  Serbia,   and  Bulgaria  -   because  these\\ngovernments really didn\\'t want the Jews to escape. As a result of\\nthe Turkish consuls\\' efforts, about 3,000 to 4,000 of the Turkish\\nJews  in  France were  saved.  Another  3,000  were sent  off  to\\nAuschwitz, where  most of them  died. The remaining  3,000 either\\nescaped  across the  border into  Spain or  fled to  the area  of\\nsouthern France occupied  by the Italians, who  treated Jews much\\nbetter than  the Nazis did.  At the  end of 1943,  however, Italy\\nfell out of the war, and that was the end for those Jews as well.\\nIncidentally, the Turkish diplomats  in Nazi-occupied Greece also\\nworked to rescue Jews in that country.\\n\\n- The second part of your  book then deals with Turkish diplomats\\nacting to  rescue Jews of  Turkish citizenship or  Turkish origin\\nfrom Nazi persecution.\\n\\nYes,  and  there  is  an  aside   I  might  add  here:  In  their\\ninterventions on  behalf of Turkish  Jews, the Turks  cited their\\ntreaty with Germany which stated  that Turkish citizens in German\\nterritory would be treated the same as German citizens in Turkey.\\nOn  that basis  the Turks  maintained  that the  Nazis could  not\\ndiscriminate  against Turkish  citizens who  are Jews.  The Nazis\\nclaimed  (and the  Vichy government  agreed) that  they were  not\\ndiscriminating  because  they  were treating  all  Jews  equally.\\nTurkey  protested,   saying,  \"You  are  dividing   our  citizens\\naccording to religion, but the Turkish constitution requires that\\nall  citizens   be  treated  equally,  regardless   of  religion.\\nTherefore, you cannot single  out Turkish Jews.\" American consuls\\nin  Paris,  by contrast,  accepted  the  Nazi argument  and  told\\nAmerican Jews  who were being  persecuted by the Nazis  that they\\ncouldn\\'t do  anything about  it, because  the American  Jews were\\nbeing treated the same as other  Jews. The third part of the book\\ntakes place in Turkey, which  was the principal center during the\\nHolocaust for activities aimed at  the rescue of Eastern European\\nJews. The  kwish Agency, an  organization established by  Jews in\\nPalestine to help resettle Jews to Palestine, set up an office in\\nIstanbul  in 1940  under the  leadership of  Chaim Barlas.  Other\\nJewish organizations in Palestine, especially the kibbutzes, also\\nsent representatives  to Istanbul  to set up  headquarters. These\\ngroups first tried to contact Jews  in Eastern Europe to find out\\nwhat was  happening. Today  we know about  the Holocaust,  but at\\nthat  time people  didn\\'t know  what  was going  on. They  didn\\'t\\nimagine the Nazis could do the things they were doing. And so the\\nfirst step was to get information, and the Turkish government let\\nthem use the Turkish mails to send letters to their relatives and\\nfriends  in Eastern  Europe. The  Jewish organizations  found out\\nwhat was happening when they  received replies. Later on when the\\nNazis  began  to  intercept   such  letters,  the  Jews  received\\nassistance  also from  the  Vatican nuncio,  Angelo Roncali,  who\\nserved as  the Vatican  representative in  Istanbul from  1935 to\\n1944  and   later  became  Pope   John  XXIII.  As   the  Vatican\\nrepresentative  during the  war, he  used the  facilities of  the\\nCatholic  Church to  supplement what  the Turkish  government was\\ndoing to  assist Jewish  agencies in  contacting Jews  in Eastern\\nEurope.  With the  cooperation of  the Turkish  government, these\\nagencies  then  sent  hard  currency, food,  clothing,  and  even\\nrailroad  and  steamship  tickets   to  Jews  in  Czechoslovakia,\\nBulgaria, Romania, and Hungary. They weren\\'t able to help much in\\nPoland because  by then the  Nazis had  wiped out almost  all the\\nPolish Jews.  Whenever possible the rescue  agencies arranged for\\nthe Jews to get out of Eastern Europe either by train through the\\nso called  Orient Express route  to Istanbul, or by  boat through\\nthe Black Sea to Istanbul.\\n\\nTurkey was not eager for all  these refugees to remain within its\\nborders during  the war, because  it was being blockaded  and was\\nsuffering   terrible  shortages   of  food   and  clothing.   The\\ngovernment,   therefore,   facilitated   the  movement   of   the\\nnon-Turkish Jewish  refugees from Turkey to  Palestine, either by\\nthe Taurus  Express Railroad through  the mountains to  Syria and\\nPalestine,  or by  small boats  across the  eastern Mediterranean\\nfrom southern  Turkey to  Palestine. These efforts  were bitterly\\nopposed not only  by the Nazis, but also by  the British, who did\\nnot want  any more Jewish  immigration to Palestine  because they\\nfeared it would hurt their  relations with the Arabs. The British\\nconstantly pressured the Turkish  government to stop this traffic\\nand send those Jews back. In  a few cases the Turkish government,\\nyielding  to  British pressure,  did  send  the boats  back.  For\\nexample, in  one incident,  the steamship  Struma, with  some 700\\nJewish  refugees  from Romania,  was  sent  back by  the  Turkish\\ngovernment  as  a  result  of the  intervention  of  the  British\\nambassador. When  that ship was  sunk by a Soviet  submarine, all\\nwere lost except one person.  Nevertheless, all told, the Turkish\\ngovernment allowed no fewer than 100,000 Eastern European Jews to\\npass through  Turkish territory and  move on to  Palestine during\\nthe Second World War. The Turkish authorities also provided these\\nrefugees with facilities  and money, and gave  them permission to\\nsend money and food out of the country.\\n\\n- Many  of these  Jews who  passed  through Turkey  may still  be\\nliving in Israel.\\n\\nYes, and  their children. But  let\\'s return  for a moment  to the\\nfirst group, the Turkish Jews who  came from Europe. They did not\\ngo  on  to   Palestine;  they  stayed  in  Turkey.   It  was  the\\nnon-Turkish, Eastern  European Jews who passed  through Turkey en\\nroute to Palestine. Their story is very interesting.\\n\\n- And you have rescued it from obscurity.\\n\\nMany studies have been made of the Holocaust, but most of them do\\nnot focus on the Eastern European or Middle Eastern Jews. Most of\\nthe scholarship  has centered  on the  Western European  Jews, of\\nwhom 6 million were massacred by the Nazis. My study deals with a\\nmuch smaller  number of  people. I  have tried  to round  out the\\npicture,  and I  hope my  book  will persuade  other scholars  to\\nundertake further investigations in the history of Eastern Jews.\\n\\nWhen it  comes to numbers,  the German Jews were  also relatively\\nsmall in number. Most of the millions slain were Polish Jews. The\\nrescue  of  100,000  Eastern  European   Jews  may  not  seem  so\\nsignificant  compared  with  the  total of  6  million  who  were\\nmurdered, but it meant a lot to those who were saved.\\n\\nAbout  three-fourths   of  the  book  consists   of  documents  -\\ntranslations  of many  documents. They  are included  because the\\nstory is not well known. Not  only are people in the West unaware\\nof  the courageous  actions of  the Turkish  diplomats; even  the\\npeople of Turkey  did not know the story. I  felt that they would\\nnot  fully understand  this  remarkable  achievement unless  they\\ncould see the documents.\\n\\n- What languages are used in the documents?\\n\\nMost of them are in Turkish  or French; some are in Hebrew. There\\nis a great  deal of material in Hebrew about  the organization of\\nthe boats  going to Palestine, the  passengers, and so on,  but I\\ndid not go into those details extensively. I describe mostly what\\nTurkey did, so  most of my documents are in  Turkish or French. A\\nfew documents are  in English. The Jewish groups  in Istanbul did\\nnot necessarily  cooperate with  one another  to rescue  Jews; in\\nfact, they often fought with  one another. They took turns trying\\nto  get  the  Turkish  government to  deport  rival  groups.  For\\nexample, some of  the kibbutz groups felt that  the Jewish Agency\\nwas  run by  Western European  Jews who  were interested  only in\\nhelping  Western  European  Jews.  Finally,  in  1944,  President\\nRoosevelt sent a personal  representative, Ira Hirschman, who had\\nbeen an executive of Bloomingdale\\'s  department store in New York\\nCity, and  Hirschman managed to reconcile  their differences. The\\ndocuments related to his mission are in English.\\n\\nI also obtained many documents  from Serge Klarsfeld, a Holocaust\\nhistorian in France,  who mainly worked on the  French Jews. (His\\nfather was  killed by  the Nazis.)  He gave  me materials  he had\\ngathered in the German archives on  the Turkish Jews, so I didn\\'t\\npersonally consult the German archives.  I believe that much more\\ncan  be learned  from the  German  archives, and  I hope  someone\\nsomeday will make the effort.\\n\\n- This new book fits in well with your teaching, doesn\\'t it?\\n\\nRight. I\\'m  giving a  course on  the history of  the Jews  of the\\nOttoman  Empire.  I first  gave  the  course  two years  ago.  In\\naddition to  research, writing, and teaching,  I\\'ve been actively\\ninvolved in  the commemoration  of the  500th anniversary  of the\\ncoming of the  Jews to the Ottoman Empire. Among  other things, I\\nhelped organize  a large international conference  on the subject\\nwhich was held in Istanbul in 1992.\\n\\n- Now that your  books are finished and the  conference has taken\\nplace, what do you plan to do next?\\n\\nI\\'m working on two new books. One is a history of the Turkish War\\nfor Independence, which took place  after World War I, during the\\nyears  1918 to  1923. The  Turks warded  off the  efforts of  the\\nvictorious  European   powers  to  occupy  Turkey   and  end  its\\nindependence. The  second book is  a study of Sultan  Abdul Hamid\\nII, the last major sultan, who ruled from 1876 to 1909. He was an\\nimportant modernizer in his own  way, although he also suppressed\\nall sorts of political movements.\\n\\nStanford  J. Shaw  received  a B.A.  in History  and  an M.A.  in\\nBritish History. He then shifted to Near Eastern History, earning\\na second M.A.  and a Ph.D. at Princeton. As  a doctoral candidate\\nat Princeton, he  spent two years abroad, studying  at the School\\nof  Oriental  and  African  Studies, University  of  London;  the\\nUniversity of  Cairo, the American  University at Cairo,  and the\\nUniversity of  Istanbul. He  taught at  Harvard before  coming to\\nUCLA in 1966. His postdoctoral research has been supported by the\\nJohn Simon Guggenheim Foundation, the American Research Institute\\nin  Turkey, the  Social  Science Research  Council, the  National\\nEndowment for the Humanities, the Fulbright Program, and ISOP. He\\nhas  received  honorary  degrees   from  Harvard  University  and\\nBosporus University, Bebek, Istanbul, Turkey, and medals of honor\\nfor lifetime contributions  to the fields of  Islamic and Turkish\\nstudies from the Center for Research in Islamic History, Art, and\\nCulture in  Istanbul and from  the American Friends of  Turkey in\\nWashington,  D.C. In  addition to  undertaking many  professional\\nservice activities and public lectures  in both the United States\\nand Turkey,  Shaw has  also produced eight  books and  one edited\\nvolume. His  History of  the Ottoman Empire  and Modem  Turkey (2\\nvols.)  has been  published  in many  editions  (six editions  or\\nreprints  from 1977-1991),  and  translated  into Turkish  (1983,\\n1991) and French (1984). His book  The Jews of the Ottoman Empire\\nand  the  Turkish  Republic  (MacMillan,  London,  and  New  York\\nUniversity Press, 1992) will  be published in Turkish translation\\nby the Turkish  Historical Society, Istanbul. His  Turkey and the\\nHolocaust: Turkey\\'s  Role in Rescuing Turkish  and European Jewry\\nfrom Nazi  Persecution, 1933-1945 will be  published by Macmillan\\nPublishers,  London, and  New York  University Press  in 1993.

Turkey has however ruled out, for the second\\ntime in one week, that it would intervene militarily in Azerbaijan.\\n\\nWednesday, Inonu told reporters Ankara would not allow Azerbaijan to suffer\\ndefeat at the hands of the Armenians. \"We feel ourselves bound to help\\nAzerbaijan, but I am not in a position right now to tell you what form (that)\\nhelp may take in the future,\" he said.\\n\\nHe said Turkish aid to Azerbaijan was continuing, \"and the whole world knows\\nabout it.\"\\n\\nPrime Minister Suleyman Demirel reiterated that Turkey would not get\\nmilitarily involved in the conflict. Foreign policy decisions could not be \\nbased on street-level excitement, he said.\\n\\nThere was no immediate reaction in Ankara to regional reports, based on\\nArmenian sources in Yerevan, saying Turkish pilots and other officers were\\ncaptured when they were shot down flying Azerbaijani warplanes and \\nhelicopters.\\n\\nThe newspaper Cumhuriyet said Turkish troops were digging in along the border\\nwith Armenia, but military sources denied reports based on claims by local\\npeople that gunfire was heard along the border. No military action has \\noccurred, the sources said.\\n\\nThe latest upsurge in fighting between the Armenians and Azerbaijanis flared\\nearly this month when Armenian forces seized the town of Kelbajar and later\\npositioned themselves outside Fizuli, near the Iranian border.\\n\\n',\n  \"There are two conflicting reports about a pitcher that is\\neither in the Jays' farm system or the Braves'.

A button widget, when pressed, will cause a new item\\nto be drawn in the Window.  This action clearly should not call XCopyArea() \\n(or equiv) directly; instead, it should register the existence of the new\\nitem in a memory structure and let the same expose event handler that handles\\n\"regular\" expose events (e.g. window manager-driven exposures) take care\\nof rendering the new image.  Using an expose event handler is a \"proper\" way\\nto do this because at the time the handler is called, the Xlib Window is\\nguaranteed to be mapped.\\n\\nThe problem, of course, is that no expose event is generated if the window\\nis already visible and mapped.

The gun when working\\ncorrectly is totally drop safe.\\n\\nNow, in police work this is a consideration.  There is not a single\\ndocumented case I'm aware of where a police officer was killed because\\nhe failed to operate the safety on his firearm.  There are quite a few\\ndocumented cases where criminals got hold of the cops gun and couldn't\\nfigure out how to get the safety off in time to use the gun, thus the\\nproprietary nature of the safety (to the criminal at least) very likely\\nprevented the office from getting shot.\\n\\nThe purpose of a safety is to make the gun safe from unintentional fire.\\nThis does not mean it should be so complicated as to slow down\\nintentional use!

By \\nreaffirming that the lifestyle is sinful according to the Bible, are \\nthey using \"a bullwhip to drive people from Jesus\"? \\n\\nFrankly, I find the occurance of a homosexual Christian attempting to \\npass himself off as a \\'straight\\' Christian in order to have other \\nChristians accept his chastisement better a *lot* more serious than \\npeople reaffirming that the Bible teaches homosexuality is a sin.

Full\\n  descriptions are given in Bennett [BEN87] and Bergen and Caelli\\n  [BER91].\\n\\n  decrypt WordPerfect document files and I think I have a solution. \\n  There is a software company named: Accessdata (87 East 600 South,\\n  Orem, UT 84058), 1-800-658-5199 that has a software package that will\\n  decrypt any WordPerfect, Lotus 1-2-3, Quatro-Pro, MS Excel and Paradox\\n  files. The cost of the package is $185. Steep prices, but if you\\n  think your pw key is less than 10 characters, (or 10 char) give them a\\n  call and ask for the free demo disk. The demo disk will decrypt files\\n  that have a 10 char or less pw key.\\'\\'\\n\\n* How do I break a Vigenere (repeated-key) cipher?\\n\\n  A repeated-key cipher, where the ciphertext is something like the\\n  plaintext xor KEYKEYKEYKEY (and so on), is called a Vigenere cipher.\\n  If the key is not too long and the plaintext is in English, do the\\n  following: \\n\\n  1. Discover the length of the key by counting coincidences.\\n  (See Gaines [GAI44], Sinkov [SIN66].) Trying each displacement of\\n  the ciphertext against itself, count those bytes which are equal. \\n  If the two ciphertext portions have used the same key, something\\n  over 6% of the bytes will be equal. If they have used different\\n  key, then less than 0.4% will be equal (assuming random 8-bit bytes\\n  of key covering normal ASCII text). The smallest displacement which\\n  indicates an equal key is the length of the repeated key.\\n\\n  2. Shift the text by that length and XOR it with itself. This\\n  removes the key and leaves you with text XORed with itself. Since\\n  English has about 1 bit of real information per byte, 2 streams of\\n  text XORed together has 2 bits of info per 8-bit byte, providing\\n  plenty of redundancy for choosing a unique decryption. (And in fact\\n  one stream of text XORed with itself has just 1 bit per byte.)\\n\\n  If the key is short, it might be even easier to treat this as a\\n  standard polyalphabetic substitution. All the old cryptanalysis\\n  texts show how to break those. It\\'s possible with those methods, in\\n  the hands of an expert, if there\\'s only ten times as much text as key.\\n  See, for example, Gaines [GAI44], Sinkov [SIN66].\\n\\n* How do I send encrypted mail under UNIX? [PGP, RIPEM, PEM, ...]\\n\\n  Here\\'s one popular method, using the des command:\\n\\n    cat file | compress | des private_key | uuencode | mail\\n\\n  Meanwhile, there is a de jure Internet standard in the works called\\n  PEM (Privacy Enhanced Mail). It is described in RFCs 1421 through\\n  1424. To join the PEM mailing list, contact pem-dev-request@tis.com.\\n  There is a beta version of PEM being tested at the time of this\\n  writing.\\n\\n  There are also two programs available in the public domain for encrypting\\n  mail: PGP and RIPEM.  Both are available by FTP.  Each has its own\\n  newsgroup: alt.security.pgp and alt.security.ripem.  Each has its own FAQ\\n  as well.\\n\\n  PGP is most commonly used outside the USA since it uses the RSA algorithm\\n  without a license and RSA\\'s patent is valid only (or at least primarily)\\n  in the USA.\\n\\n  RIPEM is most commonly used inside the USA since it uses the RSAREF which\\n  is freely available within the USA but not available for shipment outside\\n  the USA.\\n\\n  Since both programs use a secret key algorithm for encrypting the body of\\n  the message (PGP used IDEA; RIPEM uses DES) and RSA for encrypting the\\n  message key, they should be able to interoperate freely.  Although there\\n  have been repeated calls for each to understand the other\\'s formats and\\n  algorithm choices, no interoperation is available at this time (as far as\\n  we know).\\n\\n* Is the UNIX crypt command secure?\\n\\n  No. See [REE84]. There is a program available called cbw (crypt\\n  breaker\\'s workbench) which can be used to do ciphertext-only attacks\\n  on files encrypted with crypt. One source for CBW is [FTPCB].\\n\\n* How do I use compression with encryption?\\n\\n  A number of people have proposed doing perfect compression followed by\\n  some simple encryption method (e.g., XOR with a repeated key).\\n\\n  Unfortunately, you can only compress perfectly if you know the exact\\n  distribution of possible inputs. For all practical purposes it\\'s\\n  impossible to describe ``the typical English text\\'\\' beyond coarse\\n  characteristics such as single-letter frequencies. You can build up\\n  more and more sophisticated models of your inputs, but if the enemy\\n  has a slightly more accurate model, he\\'ll be able to find some\\n  redundancy in your compressed output.\\n\\n  Note that nearly all practical compression schemes, unless they\\n  have been designed with cryptography in mind, produce output that\\n  actually starts off with high redundancy. For example, the output of\\n  UNIX compress begins with a well-known three-byte ``magic number\\'\\'\\n  that can serve as an entering wedge for cryptanalysis.\\n  \\n  This is not to say that compression before encryption is inherently a\\n  bad idea; it just has to be done very, very carefully, and by no means\\n  removes the need for strong encryption.\\n\\n  Compression after encryption is silly.\\n\\n* Is there an unbreakable cipher?\\n\\n  Yes. The one-time pad is unbreakable; see part 4. Unfortunately the\\n  one-time pad requires secure distribution of as much key material as\\n  plaintext.\\n\\n  Of course, a cryptosystem need not be utterly unbreakable to be\\n  useful. Rather, it needs to be strong enough to resist attacks by\\n  likely enemies for whatever length of time the data it protects is\\n  expected to remain valid.\\n\\n* What does ``random\\'\\' mean in cryptography?\\n\\n  Cryptographic applications demand much more out of a pseudorandom\\n  number generator than most applications. For a source of bits to be\\n  cryptographically random, it must be computationally impossible to\\n  predict what the Nth random bit will be given complete knowledge of\\n  the algorithm or hardware generating the stream and the sequence of\\n  0th through N-1st bits, for all N up to the lifetime of the source.\\n\\n  A software generator (also known as pseudo-random) has the function\\n  of expanding a truly random seed to a longer string of apparently\\n  random bits.  This seed must be large enough not to be guessed by\\n  the opponent.  Ideally, it should also be truly random (perhaps\\n  generated by a hardware random number source).\\n\\n  Those who have Sparcstation 1 workstations could, for example,\\n  generate random numbers using the audio input device as a source of\\n  entropy, by not connecting anything to it.  For example,\\n\\n\\tcat /dev/audio | compress - &gt;foo\\n\\n  gives a file of high entropy (not random but with much randomness in\\n  it).  One can then encrypt that file using part of itself as a key,\\n  for example, to convert that seed entropy into a pseudo-random\\n  string.\\n\\n  When looking for hardware devices to provide this entropy, it is\\n  important really to measure the entropy rather than just assume that\\n  because it looks complicated to a human, it must be \"random\".  For\\n  example, disk operation completion times sound like they might be\\n  unpredictable (to many people) but a spinning disk is much like a\\n  clock and its output completion times are relatively low in entropy.\\n\\n* What is the unicity point (a.k.a. unicity distance)?\\n\\n  See [SHA49]. The unicity distance is an approximation to that amount\\n  of ciphertext such that the sum of the real information (entropy) in\\n  the corresponding source text and encryption key equals the number\\n  of ciphertext bits used. Ciphertexts significantly longer than this\\n  can be shown probably to have a unique decipherment. This is used to\\n  back up a claim of the validity of a ciphertext-only cryptanalysis. \\n  Ciphertexts significantly shorter than this are likely to have\\n  multiple, equally valid decryptions and therefore to gain security\\n  from the opponent\\'s difficulty choosing the correct one.\\n\\n  Unicity distance, like all statistical or information-theoretic\\n  measures, does not make deterministic predictions but rather gives\\n  probabilistic results: namely, the minimum amount of ciphertext\\n  for which it is likely that there is only a single intelligible\\n  plaintext corresponding to the ciphertext, when all possible keys\\n  are tried for the decryption. Working cryptologists don\\'t normally\\n  deal with unicity distance as such. Instead they directly determine\\n  the likelihood of events of interest.\\n\\n  Let the unicity distance of a cipher be D characters. If fewer than\\n  D ciphertext characters have been intercepted, then there is not\\n  enough information to distinguish the real key from a set of\\n  possible keys. DES has a unicity distance of 17.5 characters,\\n  which is less than 3 ciphertext blocks (each block corresponds to\\n  8 ASCII characters). This may seem alarmingly low at first, but\\n  the unicity distance gives no indication of the computational work\\n  required to find the key after approximately D characters have been\\n  intercepted.\\n\\n  In fact, actual cryptanalysis seldom proceeds along the lines used\\n  in discussing unicity distance. (Like other measures such as key\\n  size, unicity distance is something that guarantees insecurity if\\n  it\\'s too small, but doesn\\'t guarantee security if it\\'s high.) Few\\n  practical cryptosystems are absolutely impervious to analysis; all\\n  manner of characteristics might serve as entering ``wedges\\'\\' to crack\\n  some cipher messages. However, similar information-theoretic\\n  considerations are occasionally useful, for example, to determine a\\n  recommended key change interval for a particular cryptosystem.\\n  Cryptanalysts also employ a variety of statistical and\\n  information-theoretic tests to help guide the analysis in the most\\n  promising directions.\\n\\n  Unfortunately, most literature on the application of information\\n  statistics to cryptanalysis remains classified, even the seminal\\n  1940 work of Alan Turing (see [KOZ84]). For some insight into the\\n  possibilities, see [KUL68] and [GOO83].\\n\\n* What is key management and why is it important?\\n\\n  One of the fundamental axioms of cryptography is that the enemy is in\\n  full possession of the details of the general cryptographic system,\\n  and lacks only the specific key data employed in the encryption. (Of\\n  course, one would assume that the CIA does not make a habit of telling\\n  Mossad about its cryptosystems, but Mossad probably finds out anyway.)\\n  Repeated use of a finite amount of key provides redundancy that can\\n  eventually facilitate cryptanalytic progress. Thus, especially in\\n  modern communication systems where vast amounts of information are\\n  transferred, both parties must have not only a sound cryptosystem but\\n  also enough key material to cover the traffic.\\n\\n  Key management refers to the distribution, authentication, and\\n  handling of keys.\\n\\n  A publicly accessible example of modern key management technology\\n  is the STU III secure telephone unit, which for classified use\\n  employs individual coded ``Crypto Ignition Keys\\'\\' and a central Key\\n  Management Center operated by NSA. There is a hierarchy in that\\n  certain CIKs are used by authorized cryptographic control\\n  personnel to validate the issuance of individual traffic keys and\\n  to perform installation/maintenance functions, such as the\\n  reporting of lost CIKs.\\n\\n  This should give an inkling of the extent of the key management\\n  problem. For public-key systems, there are several related issues,\\n  many having to do with ``whom do you trust?\\'\\'\\n\\n* Can I use pseudo-random or chaotic numbers as a key stream?\\n\\n  Chaotic equations and fractals produce an apparent randomness from\\n  relatively compact generators. Perhaps the simplest example is a\\n  linear congruential sequence, one of the most popular types of random\\n  number generators, where there is no obvious dependence between seeds\\n  and outputs. Unfortunately the graph of any such sequence will, in a\\n  high enough dimension, show up as a regular lattice. Mathematically\\n  this lattice corresponds to structure which is notoriously easy for\\n  cryptanalysts to exploit. More complicated generators have more\\n  complicated structure, which is why they make interesting pictures---\\n  but a cryptographically strong sequence will have no computable\\n  structure at all.\\n\\n  See [KNU81], exercise 3.5-7; [REE77]; and [BOY89].\\n\\n* What is the correct frequency list for English letters?\\n\\n  There are three answers to this question, each slightly deeper than\\n  the one before. You can find the first answer in various books:\\n  namely, a frequency list computed directly from a certain sample of\\n  English text. Of course any such list will be ``correctly\\'\\' computed,\\n  but exactly which list you get depends on which sample was taken.\\n\\n  The second answer is that the question doesn\\'t make sense. What do\\n  you mean by ``English letters\\'\\'? The ``English language\\'\\' is not a\\n  fixed, finite, closed object that can be exactly characterized. It\\n  has changed over time; it is different between different authors.\\n  Any particular message will have different statistics from those of\\n  the language as a whole.\\n\\n  The third answer is that yes, no particular message is going to have\\n  exactly the same characteristics as English in general, but for all\\n  reasonable statistical uses these slight discrepancies won\\'t matter.\\n  In fact there\\'s an entire field called ``Bayesian statistics\\'\\' (other\\n  buzzwords are ``maximum entropy methods\\'\\' and ``maximum likelihood\\n  estimation\\'\\') which studies questions like ``What\\'s the chance that a\\n  text with these letter frequencies is in English?\\'\\' and comes up with\\n  reasonably robust answers.\\n\\n  So make your own list from your own samples of English text. It will\\n  be good enough for practical work, if you use it properly.\\n\\n* What is the Enigma?\\n\\n  ``For a project in data security we are looking for sources of\\n  information about the German Enigma code and how it was broken by\\n  the British during WWII.\\'\\'\\n\\n  See [WEL82], [DEA85], [KOZ84], [HOD83], [KAH91].\\n\\n* How do I shuffle cards?\\n\\n  Card shuffling is a special case of the permutation of an array of\\n  values, using a random or pseudo-random function.  All possible output\\n  permutations of this process should be equally likely.  To do this, you\\n  need a random function (modran(x)) which will produce a uniformly\\n  distributed random integer in the interval [0..x-1].  Given that\\n  function, you can shuffle with the following [C] code: (assuming ARRLTH\\n  is the length of array arr[] and swap() interchanges values at the two\\n  addresses given)\\n\\n  for ( n = ARRLTH-1; n &gt; 0 ; n-- ) swap( &arr[modran( n+1 )], &arr[n] ) ;\\n\\n  modran(x) can not be achieved exactly with a simple (ranno() % x) since\\n  ranno()\\'s interval may not be divisible by x, although in most cases the\\n  error will be very small.  To cover this case, one can take ranno()\\'s\\n  modulus mod x, call that number y, and if ranno() returns a value less\\n  than y, go back and get another ranno() value.\\n\\n\\n* Can I foil S/W pirates by encrypting my CD-ROM?\\n\\n  Someone will frequently express the desire to publish a CD-ROM with\\n  possibly multiple pieces of software, perhaps with each encrypted\\n  separately, and will want to use different keys for each user (perhaps\\n  even good for only a limited period of time) in order to avoid piracy.\\n\\n  As far as we know, this is impossible, since there is nothing in standard\\n  PC or workstation hardware which uniquely identifies the user at the\\n  keyboard.  If there were such an identification, then the CD-ROM could be\\n  encrypted with a key based in part on the one sold to the user and in\\n  part on the unique identifier.  However, in this case the CD-ROM is one\\n  of a kind and that defeats the intended purpose.\\n\\n  If the CD-ROM is to be encrypted once and then mass produced, there must\\n  be a key (or set of keys) for that encryption produced at some stage in\\n  the process.  That key is useable with any copy of the CD-ROM\\'s data.\\n  The pirate needs only to isolate that key and sell it along with the\\n  illegal copy.\\n\\n\\n* Can you do automatic cryptanalysis of simple ciphers?\\n\\n  Utah sells products that break the password scheme of a number of\\n  popular Macintosh and PC software packages.

Where can I get patches to X11R5?\\n\\n\\tThe release of new public patches by the MIT X Consortium is announced\\nin the comp.windows.x.announce newsgroup.\\n\\n\\tPatches themselves are available via ftp from export and from other\\nsites from which X11 is available. They are now also distributed through the \\nnewsgroup comp.sources.x. Some source re-sellers may be including patches in \\ntheir source distributions of X11.\\n\\n\\tPeople without ftp access can use the xstuff mail server. It now has \\n23 patches for X11R5 [3/93].  Send to xstuff@expo.lcs.mit.edu the Subject line\\n\\t\\tsend fixes #\\nwhere # is the name of the patch and is usually just the number of the patch.\\n\\n\\tHere are a few complications:\\n\\t1) fix 5 is in four parts; you need to request \"5a\", \"5b\", \"5c\" and \\n\"5d\" separately\\n\\t2) the file sunGX.uu, which was part of an earlier patch, was \\nre-released with patch 7 [note: the file doesn\\'t work with Solaris]\\n\\t3) fix 8 is in two parts: \"8a\" and \"8b\"\\n\\t4) fix 13 is in three parts: \"13a\", \"13b\", and \"13c\"\\n\\t5) fix 16 is in two parts: \"16a\" and \"16b\"\\n\\t6) fix 18 replaces the R5fix-test1 for the X Test Suite, which \\npreviously was optional\\n\\t7) fix 19 also needs PEXlib.tar.Z, which you can obtain from xstuff\\nby asking for \"PEXlib.uu.[1234]\".\\n\\t8) fix 22 is in 9 parts, \"22a\" through \"22i\"\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject:  59)  What is the xstuff mail-archive?\\n\\n\\tThe xstuff server is a mail-response program. That means that you mail \\nit a request, and it mails back the response.\\n\\tAny of the four possible commands must be the first word on a line. The\\nxstuff server reads your entire message before it does anything, so you can \\nhave several different commands in a single message (unless you ask for help). \\nThe xstuff server treats the \"Subject:\" header line just like any other line \\nof the message.\\n\\tThe archives are organized into a series of directories and \\nsubdirectories.  Each directory has an index, and each subdirectory has an \\nindex. The top-level index gives you an overview of what is in the \\nsubdirectories, and the index for each subdirectory tells you what is in it.\\n\\n\\t1) The command \"help\" or \"send help\" causes the server to send you a \\nmore detailed version of this help file.\\n\\t2) if your message contains a line whose first word is \"index\", then \\nthe server will send you the top-level index of the contents of the archive. If\\nthere are other words on that line that match the name of subdirectories, then \\nthe indexes for those subdirectories are sent instead of the top-level index. \\nFor example, you can say \"send index fixes\" (or \"index fixes\"). A message that \\nrequests an index cannot request data.\\n\\t3) if your message contains a line whose first word is \"send\", then the\\nxstuff server will send you the item(s) named on the rest of the line. To name \\nan item, you give its directory and its name. For example\\n                send fixes 1 4 8a 8b 9\\n\\tYou may issue multiple send requests. The xstuff server contains many \\nsafeguards to ensure that it is not monopolized by people asking for large \\namounts of data. The mailer is set up so that it will send no more than a fixed\\namount of data each day. If the work queue contains more requests than the \\nday\\'s quota, then the unsent files will not be processed until the next day. \\nWhenever the mailer is run to send its day\\'s quota, it sends the requests out \\nshortest-first.\\n\\t4) Some mailers produce mail headers that are unusable for extracting \\nreturn addresses.  If you use such a mailer, you won\\'t get any response.  If \\nyou happen to know an explicit path, you can include a line like\\n        path foo%bar.bitnet@mitvma.mit.edu\\nor\\n        path bar!foo!frotz\\nin the body of your message, and the daemon will use it.\\n\\n\\tThe xstuff server itself can be reached at xstuff@expo.lcs.mit.edu. If \\nyour mailer deals in \"!\" notation, try sending to \\n{someplace}!mit-eddie!expo.lcs.mit.edu!xstuff.\\n\\n[based on information from the MIT X Consortium, 8/89, 4/90.]\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject:  60)!

On a scale from cold to\\nhot, you are at 0 degrees Kelvin.\\n\\n\\nThen as you understand it, what is it?\\n\\n\\nYes.  I agree with that.  But what does that have to do with Jesus?\\nPunishment you say?  Jesus did not regard his death as punishment. \\n\\n\\nGood.  I wouldn\\'t either--not the way you understand it.  \\n\\n\\nAsk Jesus himself.  He himself said why in John 12:23-32.  It\\nisn\\'t a mystery to anyone and there certainly is no need for\\na persuasive argument.   Read Jesus\\'s own reply to your\\nquestion.\\n\\nJesus gives more reasons in John 16:7.  But one obvious reason\\nwhy Jesus died, (and as with everything else, it has nothing do with\\nhis punishment) was that he could rise to life again--so that\\nwe would \"stop doubting and believe\" (John 21:27).  The fact\\nthat Jesus rose from the dead is my hope that I too will rise\\nfrom the dead.  It is an obvious point.  Do not overlook it.\\nWithout this obvious point, I would have no hope\\nand my faith would be vanity.\\n\\nWhy did Jesus suffer in his death?  Again, ask Jesus.  Jesus\\nsays why in John 15:18-25.

Hence big cooling towers.  \\n\\n       Oil and gas fired steam plants also have condensers, but they\\nusually are sized to get the steam back into hot water, not most of the\\nway down to ambient.  Some plants do cool the condensers with water,\\nrather than air; as one Canadian official, asked about \"thermal \\npollution\" de-icing a river, said, \"Up here, we view heat as a resource\".  \\n\\n       Everybody runs closed-cycle boilers.

I got it from\\na The Morning Star, and am posting it with the permission of the\\neditor.\\n\\n\\n    Saint Aloysius Gonzaga\\n\\n    The Patron of Youth\\n\\n\\n    The marquis Gonzaga had high aspirations for his son, the  Prince\\n    Gonzage.  He  wanted  him  to become a famous, brave and honoured\\n    soldier. After all, he must carry on the  great  family  name  of\\n    Gonzaga.  Of  course, he was to become far more famous, brave and\\n    honoured than his father could ever have imagined; though not  in\\n    the manner expected.\\n\\n    Saint Aloysius\\' mother was a woman who received immense joy  from\\n    praying  to  God  and  meditating on the divine mysteries and the\\n    life of Our Lord. She had little time for the pleasures  of  this\\n    life.  As  Saint  Aloysius\\tgrew, he began to resemble his mother\\n    more than his father.\\n\\n    Saint Aloysius had learned numerous expressions from his father\\'s\\n    soldiers,  but the moment he discovered that they were vulgar, he\\n    fainted from shock. This shows his immense hatred of sin (What an\\n    example for us of the contempt we must have for sin).\\n\\n    About the time of his First Holy  Communion  (which  he  received\\n    from  the  Archbishop  of  Milan,  Charles Borromeo, whom himself\\n    became a great Saint), he con-secrated  his  purity  to  God  and\\n    asked the Blessed Virgin to protect his innocence for life.\\n\\n    He wanted to share Our Lord\\'s suffering to\\tshow  his  reciprocal\\n    love.  He  started by denying his passions; he avoided eating the\\n    finest foods, wearing the best clothes, and would put  pieces  of\\n    wood  in his bed in order to mortify himself for the love of God.\\n    While he was in his early teens his  father  sent  him  (and  his\\n    younger  brother)  to  the court of the Spanish King, Phillip 11.\\n    Obediently, he set out to make the best of it. He mixed  in  well\\n    with  the people of the royal court, for he was handsome, polite,\\n    intelligent and always had something interesting to say.\\n\\n\\n    Not long before this time, the great soldier-saint,  Saint\\tIgna-\\n    tius  of  Loyola,  had founded the Society of Jesus (the Jesuits)\\n    towards which Saint Aloysius\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t  -12-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    began to have a yearning. When he finally told  his  father,  the\\n    marquis flew into a rage and forbade his son to become a priest.\\n\\n    After a short time, his father sent him to the  great  cities  in\\n    order that he be tempted away from the priesthood, but even\\n\\n    through these trials, Saint Aloysius grew in his desire  for  the\\n    religious life and was strengthened in the virtue of purity.\\n\\n    The Marquis\\' plans were obviously failing, so he con-fronted  his\\n    son:  \"Will  you or will you not obey me and forget this foolish-\\n    ness?\" \"I will not, father,\" was the  in-evitable  reply.\\t\"Then\\n    leave from my sight and don\\'t return until you change your mind!\"\\n    With tears clouding his eyes, the Saint left the  room  to\\tpray:\\n    \"Tell  me Lord, what am I to do? Tell me! Tell me!\" He knelt down\\n    to flagellate himself as he had done several  times  before,  but\\n    this  time\\the was seen. The onlooker rushed to the marquis. This\\n    at last brought the proud man to his senses. \"The Lord wants him,\\n    the Lord can have him.\" He gave his consent for his son to become\\n    a Jesuit.\\n\\n    After some years (at the end of the sixteenth century), a  terri-\\n    ble  epidemic  broke out in Rome.

Why do atheists organize in groups?  \\nWhat is there to discuss?\\n\\nResponse:\\n\\nMany things are discussed here, including:\\n\\n* Whether it is reasonable to feign theism in order to avoid upsetting one\\'s\\n  family\\n* Prayer in schools\\n* Discrimination against atheists\\n* Sunday trading laws\\n* The Satanic Child Abuse myth\\n* Whether one should be an overt atheist or \\'stay in the closet\\'\\n* How religious societies prey (sic) on new college students\\n* How to get rid of unwanted proselytizers\\n* Whether religion is a danger to society and/or the individual\\n* Why people become atheists\\n\\nOf course, inevitably alt.atheism tends to attract evangelical Christians\\nlooking for someone to convert.

As he said himself:\\n\\n   The folkish-minded man, in particular, has the sacred duty, each in\\n   his own denomination, of making _people_stop_just_talking_\\n   superficially_of_God\\'s_will,_and_actually_fulfill_God\\'s_will,_and_\\n   not_let_God\\'s_word_be_desecrated._[orig. ital.]\\n\\n   For God\\'s will gave men their form, their essence, and their\\n   abilities.  Anyone who destroys His work is declaring war on the\\n   Lord\\'s creation, the divine will.  Therefore, let every man be\\n   active, each in his own denomination if you please, and let every\\n   man take it as his first and most sacred duty to oppose anyone who\\n   in his activity by word or deed steps outside the confines of his\\n   religious community and tries to butt into the other.\\n\\n   [...]\\n\\n   Hence today I believe that I am acting in accordance with the will\\n   of the Almighty Creator: _by_defending_myself_against_the_Jew,_I_am_\\n   fighting_for_the_work_of_the_Lord._[orig. ital.]\\n\\n          -- Adolf Hitler, from \"Mein Kampf\", trans. Ralph Mannheim.\\n\\nOf course, someone bad believing something does not make that belief\\nwrong.  It\\'s also entirely possible that Hitler was lying when he claimed \\nto believe in God.  We certainly can\\'t conclude that he\\'s an atheist, \\nthough.\\n\\n------------------------------\\n\\nSubject: The Bible proves it\\n\\nTypical posting:\\n\\nIn the Bible it says that...\\n\\nResponse:\\n\\nMost of the readers of alt.atheism feel that the Bible is of questionable\\naccuracy, as it was written thousands of years ago by many authors who were\\nrecording oral tradition that existed many years before.  Thus, any claimed\\n\\'truth\\' in it is of questionable legitimacy.  This isn\\'t to say that The\\nBible has no truth in it; simply that any truth must be examined before being\\naccepted.\\n\\nMany of the readers of this group also feel that because any passage is\\nsubject to \"interpretation\", any claim that a passage \\'means\\' one thing and\\none thing only is not legitimate.\\n\\nNote that this feeling tends to extend to other books.\\n\\nIt is also remarkable to many atheists that theists tend to ignore other\\nequally plausible religious books in favour of those of their own religion.\\n\\n------------------------------\\n\\nSubject: Pascal\\'s Wager\\n\\nTypical posting:\\n\\nIf you believe in God and turn out to be incorrect, you have lost nothing --\\nbut if you don\\'t believe in God and turn out to be incorrect, you will go to\\nhell. Therefore it is foolish to be an atheist.\\n\\nResponse:\\n\\nThis argument is known as Pascal\\'s Wager.  It has several flaws.\\n\\nFirstly, it does not indicate which religion to follow.  Indeed, there are\\nmany mutually exclusive and contradictory religions out there.  This is often\\ndescribed as the \"avoiding the wrong hell\" problem.  If a person is a\\nfollower of religion X, he may end up in religion Y\\'s version of hell.\\n\\nSecondly, the statement that \"If you believe in God and turn out to be\\nincorrect, you have lost nothing\" is not true.  Suppose you\\'re believing in\\nthe wrong God -- the true God might punish you for your foolishness.\\nConsider also the deaths that have resulted from people rejecting medicine in\\nfavour of prayer.\\n\\nAnother flaw in the argument is that it is based on the assumption that \\nthe two possibilities are equally likely -- or at least, that they are of \\ncomparable likelihood.  If, in fact, the possibility of there being a God \\nis close to zero, the argument becomes much less persuasive.  So sadly the\\nargument is only likely to convince those who believe already.\\n\\nAlso, many feel that for intellectually honest people, belief is based on \\nevidence, with some amount of intuition.  It is not a matter of will or \\ncost-benefit analysis.\\n\\nFormally speaking, the argument consists of four statements:\\n\\n  1. One does not know whether God exists.\\n  2. Not believing in God is bad for one\\'s eternal soul if God does\\n     exist.\\n  3. Believing in God is of no consequence if God does not exist.\\n  4. Therefore it is in one\\'s interest to believe in God.\\n\\nThere are two approaches to the argument.  The first is to view 1 as an\\nassumption, and 2 as a consequence of it.  One problem with this approach, in\\nthe abstract, is that it creates information from no information.  This is\\nconsidered invalid in information theory.  Statement 1 indicates one has no\\ninformation about God -- but statement 2 indicates that beneficial information\\ncan be gained from the absolute lack of information about God.  This violates\\ninformation entropy -- information has been extracted from no information, at\\nno \"cost\".\\n\\nThe alternative approach is to claim that 1 and 2 are both assumptions.  The\\nproblem with this is that 2 is then basically an assumption which states the\\nChristian position, and only a Christian will agree with that assumption. The\\nargument thus collapses to \"If you are a Christian, it is in your interests\\nto believe in God\" -- a rather vacuous tautology, and not the way Pascal\\nintended the argument to be viewed.\\n\\nThe biggest reason why Pascal\\'s wager is a failure is that if God is\\nomniscient he will certainly know who really believes and who believes as\\na wager.  He will spurn the latter... assuming he actually cares at all\\nwhether people believe in him.\\n\\n------------------------------\\n\\nSubject: What is Occam\\'s Razor?\\n\\nTypical posting:\\n\\nPeople keep talking about Occam\\'s Razor.  What is it?\\n\\nResponse:\\n\\nWilliam of Occam formulated a principle which has become known as Occam\\'s \\nRazor.  In its original form, it said \"Do not multiply entities \\nunnecessarily.\"  That is, if you can explain something without supposing\\nthe existence of some entity, then do so.\\n\\nNowadays when people refer to Occam\\'s Razor, they generally express it \\nmore generally, for example as \"Take the simplest solution\".\\n\\nThe relevance to atheism is that we can look at two possible explanations \\nfor what we see around us:\\n\\n1. There is an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there, which\\ncame into being as a result of natural processes.\\n\\n2. There is an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there, and \\nthere is also a God who created the universe.  Clearly this God must be \\nof non-zero complexity.\\n\\nGiven that both explanations fit the facts, Occam\\'s Razor might suggest \\nthat we should take the simpler of the two -- solution number one.\\nUnfortunately, some argue that there is a third even more simple solution:\\n\\n3. There isn\\'t an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there.  \\nWe just imagine that there is.\\n\\nThis third option leads us logically towards solipsism, which many people \\nfind unacceptable.\\n \\n------------------------------\\n\\nSubject: Why it\\'s good to believe in Jesus\\n\\nTypical posting:\\n\\nI want to tell people about the virtues and benefits of my religion.\\n\\nResponse:\\n\\nPreaching is not appreciated.\\n\\nFeel free to talk about your religion, but please do not write postings that\\nare on a \"conversion\" theme.  Such postings do not belong on alt.atheism and\\nwill be rejected from alt.atheism.moderated (try the newsgroup\\ntalk.religion.misc).\\n\\nYou would doubtless not welcome postings from atheists to your favourite\\nnewsgroup in an attempt to convert you; please do unto others as you would\\nhave them do unto you!\\n\\nOften theists make their basic claims about God in the form of lengthy\\nanalogies or parables.  Be aware that atheists have heard of God and know the\\nbasic claims about him; if the sole purpose of your parable is to tell\\natheists that God exists and brings salvation, you may as well not post it,\\nsince it tells us nothing we have not been told before.\\n\\n------------------------------\\n\\nSubject: Why I know that God exists\\n\\nTypical posting:\\n\\nI *know* from personal experience and prayer that God exists.\\n\\nResponse:\\n\\nJust as many theists have personal evidence that the being they worship\\nexists, so many atheists have personal evidence that such beings do not\\nexist.  That evidence varies from person to person.\\n\\nFurthermore, without wishing to dismiss your evidence out of hand, many\\npeople have claimed all kinds of unlikely things -- that they have been\\nabducted by UFOs, visited by the ghost of Elvis, and so on.\\n\\n------------------------------\\n\\nSubject: Einstein and \"God does not play dice\"\\n\\nTypical posting:\\n\\nAlbert Einstein believed in God.  Do you think you\\'re cleverer than him?\\n\\nResponse:\\n\\nEinstein did once comment that \"God does not play dice [with the universe]\". \\nThis quotation is commonly mentioned to show that Einstein believed in the\\nChristian God.  Used this way, it is out of context; it refers to Einstein\\'s\\nrefusal to accept the uncertainties indicated by quantum theory. Furthermore,\\nEinstein\\'s religious background was Jewish rather than Christian.\\n\\nA better quotation showing what Einstein thought about God is the following:\\n\"I believe in Spinoza\\'s God who reveals himself in the orderly harmony of\\nwhat exists, not in a God who concerns himself with fates and actions of\\nhuman beings.\"\\n\\nEinstein was unable to accept Quantum Theory because of his belief in an\\nobjective, orderly reality; a reality which would not be subject to random\\nevents and which would not be dependent upon the observer.  He believed that\\nQM was incomplete, and that a better theory would have no need for\\nstatistical interpretations.  So far no such better theory has been found,\\nand much evidence suggests that it never will be.\\n\\nA longer quote from Einstein appears in \"Science, Philosophy, and Religion, A\\nSymposium\", published by the Conference on Science, Philosophy and Religion\\nin Their Relation to the Democratic Way of Life, Inc., New York, 1941.  In\\n\\n  \"The more a man is imbued with the ordered regularity of all events\\n   the firmer becomes his conviction that there is no room left by the side\\n   of this ordered regularity for causes of a different nature.  For him\\n   neither the rule of human nor the rule of divine will exists as an\\n   independent cause of natural events.  To be sure, the doctrine of a\\n   personal God interfering with natural events could never be\\n   *refuted* [italics his], in the real sense, by science, for this\\n   doctrine can always take refuge in those domains in which scientific\\n   knowledge has not yet been able to set foot.\\n\\n   But I am convinced that such behavior on the part of representatives\\n   of religion would not only be unworthy but also fatal.  For a doctrine\\n   which is to maintain itself not in clear light but only in the dark,\\n   will of necessity lose its effect on mankind, with incalculable harm\\n   to human progress.  In their struggle for the ethical good, teachers\\n   of religion must have the stature to give up the doctrine of a personal\\n   God, that is, give up that source of fear and hope which in the past\\n   placed such vast power in the hands of priests.  In their labors they\\n   will have to avail themselves of those forces which are capable\\n   of cultivating the Good, the True, and the Beautiful in humanity\\n   itself.  This is, to be sure, a more difficult but an incomparably\\n   more worthy task...\"\\n\\n\\n  \"It was, of course, a lie what you read about my religous convictions,\\n   a lie which is being systematically repeated.  I do not believe in a\\n   personal God and I have never denied this but have expressed it clearly.\\n   If something is in me which can be called religious then it is the\\n   unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as our\\n   science can reveal it.\"\\n\\nThe latter quote is from \"Albert Einstein: The Human Side\", edited by Helen \\nDukas and Banesh Hoffman, and published by Princeton University Press.  \\nAlso from the same book:\\n\\n  \"I do not believe in immortality of the individual, and I consider ethics\\n   to be an exclusively human concern with no superhuman authority behind \\n   it.\"\\n\\nOf course, the fact that Einstein chose not to believe in Christianity does \\nnot in itself imply that Christianity is false.\\n\\n------------------------------\\n\\nSubject: Everyone worships something\\n\\nTypical posting:\\n\\nEveryone worships something, whether it\\'s money, power or God.\\n\\nResponse:\\n\\nIf that is true, everyone is a polytheist.  Theists care just as much about\\nthose things that atheists care about.  If the atheists\\' reactions to (for\\nexample) their families amount to worship then so do the theists\\'.\\n\\n------------------------------\\n\\nSubject: Why there must be a causeless cause\\n\\nTypical posting:\\n\\nSets of integers that have a lower bound each have a smallest member, so\\nchains of causes must all have a first element, a causeless cause.\\n\\nResponse:\\n\\nThe set of real numbers greater than zero has a definite lower bound, but has\\nno smallest member.\\n\\nFurther, even if it is true that there must be a causeless cause, that does\\nnot imply that that cause must be a conscious supernatural entity, and\\nespecially not that any such entity must match the description favoured by\\nany particular religion.\\n\\n------------------------------\\n\\nSubject: The universe is so complex it must have been designed\\n\\nTypical posting:\\n\\nThe presence of design in the universe proves there is a God.  Surely you\\ndon\\'t think all this appeared here just by chance?\\n\\nResponse:\\n\\nThis is known as the Argument From Design.\\n\\nIt is a matter of dispute whether there is any element of design in the\\nuniverse. Those who believe that the complexity and diversity of living\\ncreatures on the earth is evidence of a creator are best advised to read the\\nnewsgroup talk.origins for a while.\\n\\nThere is insufficient space to summarize both sides of that debate here.\\nHowever, the conclusion is that there is no scientific evidence in favour of\\nso-called Scientific Creationism. Furthermore, there is much evidence,\\nobservation and theory that can explain many of the complexities of the\\nuniverse and life on earth.\\n\\nThe origin of the Argument by Design is a feeling that the existence of\\nsomething as incredibly intricate as, say, a human is so improbable that\\nsurely it can\\'t have come about by chance; that surely there must be some \\nexternal intelligence directing things so that humans come from the chaos\\ndeliberately.\\n\\nBut if human intelligence is so improbable, surely the existence of a mind\\ncapable of fashioning an entire universe complete with conscious beings must\\nbe immeasurably more unlikely?  The approach used to argue in favour of the\\nexistence of a creator can be turned around and applied to the Creationist\\nposition.\\n\\nThis leads us to the familiar theme of \"If a creator created the universe,\\nwhat created the creator?\", but with the addition of spiralling \\nimprobability.  The only way out is to declare that the creator was not\\ncreated and just \"is\" (or \"was\").\\n\\nFrom here we might as well ask what is wrong with saying that the universe\\njust \"is\" without introducing a creator?  Indeed Stephen Hawking, in his book\\n\"A Brief History of Time\", explains his theory that the universe is closed\\nand finite in extent, with no beginning or end.\\n\\nThe Argument From Design is often stated by analogy, in the so-called \\nWatchmaker Argument.  One is asked to imagine that one has found a watch on\\nthe beach.  Does one assume that it was created by a watchmaker, or that it\\nevolved naturally?  Of course one assumes a watchmaker.  Yet like the \\nwatch, the universe is intricate and complex; so, the argument goes, the \\nuniverse too must have a creator.\\n\\nThe Watchmaker analogy suffers from three particular flaws, over and above \\nthose common to all Arguments By Design.  Firstly, a watchmaker creates \\nwatches from pre-existing materials, whereas God is claimed to have \\ncreated the universe from nothing.  These two sorts of creation are \\nclearly fundamentally different, and the analogy is therefore rather weak.\\n\\nSecondly, a watchmaker makes watches, but there are many other things in \\nthe world.  If we walked further along the beach and found a nuclear \\nreactor, we wouldn\\'t assume it was created by the watchmaker.  The argument \\nwould therefore suggest a multitude of creators, each responsible for a \\ndifferent part of creation.\\n\\nFinally, in the first part of the watchmaker argument we conclude that \\nthe watch is not part of nature because it is ordered, and therefore \\nstands out from the randomness of nature.  Yet in the second part of the \\nargument, we start from the position that the universe is obviously not \\nrandom, but shows elements of order.  The Watchmaker argument is thus \\ninternally inconsistent.\\n\\n------------------------------\\n\\nSubject: Independent evidence that the Bible is true\\n\\nTypical posting:\\n\\nThe events of the New Testament are confirmed by independent documentary\\nevidence.  For example...\\n\\nResponse:\\n\\nThe writings of Josephus are often mentioned as independent documentary\\nevidence.\\n\\nEarly versions of Josephus\\'s work are thought not to have mentioned Jesus or\\nJames; the extant version discusses John in a non-Christian context.  Many\\nscholars believe that the original mentioned Jesus and James in passing, but\\nthat this was expanded by Christian copyists.  Several \"reconstructions\" of\\nthe original text have been published to this effect.\\n\\nMuch information appears in the Ecclesiastical History of Eusebius (about 320\\nC.E.).  It is worthless as historical material because of the deliberate\\nfalsification of the wily Eusebius who is generally acknowledged as \\'the\\nfirst thoroughly dishonest historian of antiquity.\\' It is Eusebius who is\\ngenerally given the title of authorship for this material.\\n\\nAside from the New Testament, the biographical information about Jesus is\\nmore well-documented.  For further information, please consult the Frequently\\nAsked Questions file for the newsgroup soc.religion.christian.\\n\\n------------------------------\\n\\nSubject: Godel\\'s Incompleteness Theorem\\n\\nTypical posting:\\n\\nGodel\\'s Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates that it is impossible for the\\nBible to be both true and complete.\\n\\nResponse:\\n\\nGodel\\'s First Incompleteness Theorem says that in any consistent formal \\nsystem which is sufficiently expressive that it can model ordinary \\narithmetic, one can formulate expressions which can never be proven to be \\nvalid or invalid (\\'true\\' or \\'false\\') within that formal system.  (Technically\\nspeaking, the system must also be recursive; that is, there must be a decision\\nprocedure for determining whether a given string is an axiom within the formal \\nsystem.)\\n\\nEssentially, all such systems can formulate what is known as a \"Liar \\nParadox.\"  The classic Liar Paradox sentence in ordinary English is \"This \\nsentence is false.\"  Note that if a proposition is undecidable, the formal \\nsystem cannot even deduce that it is undecidable.\\n\\nThe logic used in theological discussions is rarely well defined, so claims\\nthat Godel\\'s Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates that it is impossible to\\nprove or disprove) the existence of God are worthless in isolation.\\n\\nOne can trivially define a formal system in which it is possible to prove the\\nexistence of God, simply by having the existence of God stated as an axiom. \\nThis is unlikely to be viewed by atheists as a convincing proof, however.\\n\\nIt may be possible to succeed in producing a formal system built on axioms\\nthat both atheists and theists agree with.  It may then be possible to show\\nthat Godel\\'s Incompleteness Theorem holds for that system.  However, that\\nwould still not demonstrate that it is impossible to prove that God exists\\nwithin the system.  Furthermore, it certainly wouldn\\'t tell us anything about\\nwhether it is possible to prove the existence of God generally.\\n\\nNote also that all of these hypothetical formal systems tell us nothing about\\nthe actual existence of God; the formal systems are just abstractions.\\n\\nAnother frequent claim is that Godel\\'s Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates\\nthat a religious text (the Bible, the Book of Mormon or whatever) cannot be\\nboth consistent and universally applicable. Religious texts are not formal\\nsystems, so such claims are nonsense.\\n\\n------------------------------\\n\\nSubject: George Bush on atheism and patriotism\\n\\nTypical posting:\\n\\nDid George Bush really say that atheists should not be considered citizens?\\n\\nResponse:\\n\\nThe following exchange took place at the Chicago airport between Robert I.\\nSherman of American Atheist Press and George Bush, on August 27 1988. Sherman\\nis a fully accredited reporter, and was present by invitation as a member of\\nthe press corps.  The Republican presidential nominee was there to announce\\nfederal disaster relief for Illinois.  The discussion turned to the\\npresidential primary:\\n\\n RS: \"What will you do to win the votes of Americans who are atheists?\"\\n\\n GB: \"I guess I\\'m pretty weak in the atheist community.  Faith in\\n      God is important to me.\"\\n\\n RS: \"Surely you recognize the equal citizenship and patriotism of\\n      Americans who are atheists?\"\\n\\n GB: \"No, I don\\'t know that atheists should be considered as citizens,\\n      nor should they be considered patriots.  This is one nation under\\n      God.\"\\n\\n RS: \"Do you support as a sound constitutional principle the separation\\n      of state and church?\"\\n\\n GB: \"Yes, I support the separation of church and state.  I\\'m just not\\n      very high on atheists.\"\\n\\nUPI reported on May 8, 1989, that various atheist organizations were\\nstill angry over the remarks.\\n\\nThe exchange appeared in the Boulder Daily Camera on Monday February 27,\\n1989.  It can also be found in \"Free Enquiry\" magazine, Fall 1988 issue,\\nVolume 8, Number 4, page 16.\\n\\nOn October 29, 1988, Mr. Sherman had a confrontation with Ed Murnane,\\ncochairman of the Bush-Quayle \\'88 Illinois campaign.  This concerned a\\nlawsuit Mr. Sherman had filed to stop the Community Consolidated School\\nDistrict 21 (Chicago, Illinois) from forcing his first-grade Atheist son to\\npledge allegiance to the flag of the United States as \"one nation under God\"\\n(Bush\\'s phrase).  The following conversation took place:\\n \\n RS: \"American Atheists filed the Pledge of Allegiance lawsuit yesterday.\\n      Does the Bush campaign have an official response to this filing?\"\\n \\n EM: \"It\\'s bullshit.\"\\n \\n RS: \"What is bullshit?\"\\n \\n EM: \"Everything that American Atheists does, Rob, is bullshit.\"\\n \\n RS: \"Thank you for telling me what the official position of the Bush\\n      campaign is on this issue.\"\\n\\n EM: \"You\\'re welcome.\"\\n\\nAfter Bush\\'s election, American Atheists wrote to Bush asking him to retract\\nhis statement.  On February 21st 1989, C. Boyden Gray, Counsel to the\\nPresident, replied on White House stationery that Bush substantively stood by\\n\\n  \"As you are aware, the President is a religious man who neither supports\\n   atheism nor believes that atheism should be unnecessarily encouraged or\\n   supported by the government.\"\\n\\nFor further information, contact American Atheist Veterans at the American\\nAtheist Press\\'s Cameron Road address.\\n\\n------------------------------\\n\\nSubject: I know where hell is!\\n\\nTypical posting:\\n\\nI know where Hell is!  Hell is in Norway!\\n\\nResponse:\\n\\nThere are several towns called \"Hell\" in various countries around the\\nworld, including Norway and the USA.  Whilst this information is mildly\\namusing the first time one hears it, readers of alt.atheism are now \\ngetting pretty fed up with hearing it every week.\\n\\n------------------------------\\n\\nSubject: Biblical contradictions wanted\\n\\nTypical posting:\\n\\nDoes anyone have a list of Biblical contradictions?\\n\\nResponse:\\n \\nAmerican Atheist Press publish an atheist\\'s handbook detailing Biblical\\ncontradictions. See the accompanying posting on Atheist Resources for\\ndetails.\\n\\nThere is a file containing some Biblical contradictions available from the\\narchive-server@mantis.co.uk. See the contacts file for more information.\\n\\n------------------------------\\n\\nSubject: The USA is a Christian nation\\n\\nTypical posting:\\n\\nBecause of the religious beliefs of the founding fathers, shouldn\\'t the\\nUnited States be considered a Christian nation?\\n\\nResponse:\\n\\nBased upon the writings of several important founding fathers, it is clear\\nthat they never intended the US to be a Christian nation.  Here are some\\nquotes; there are many more.\\n\\n  \"What influence, in fact, have ecclesiastical establishments had on society?\\n   In some instances they have been seen to erect a spiritual tyranny on the\\n   ruins of the civil authority; on many instances they have been seen\\n   upholding the thrones of political tyranny; in no instance have they been\\n   the guardians of the liberties of the people.

Now\\nSP&gt; after this second episode, so similar in nature to the first, even\\nSP&gt; he is scratching his head.\\n\\nThere's no data that sugar-coated cereals cause seizures.  I haven't\\neven seen anything anecdotal on it.  Given how common they are eaten\\n- do you know any child or adolescent who *doesn't* eat the stuff? -\\nI think that if there were a relationship we would know it by now.\\nAlso, there's nothing weird in those cereals.  As far as the brain\\nis concerned (except for a few infantile metabolic disorders such as\\ngalactosemia), sugar is sugar, regardless if it is coated on cereal,\\nsprinkled onto cereal, or dissolved in soda, coffee or whatever.\\n\\nThere was some interest a few years ago in aspartame lowering\\nseizure thresholds, but I don't believe anything ever came of it.\",\n  'I think it would be a great idea to have a new group created:\\n\\ncomp.sys.ibm.pc.flame.therapy',\n  '\\n\\nI\\'m not sure about that.

There are not all that many people who have both the skill\\n   AND motivation to assemble worthwhile firearms from scratch.\\n   High-ranking crime figures could obtain imported Uzis and such, but\\n   the average person, and average thug, would be lucky to get a zip-gun\\n   - and would pay through the nose for it.\\n\\nGood point you make.  However, a zip gun, by definition, is a crude,\\nhomemade gun--certainly not something capable of sustained, accurate\\nfire, but it would be useful as a means of getting a normal gun.  Recall\\nthe tiny, single-shot pistols made by the Allies during World War II for\\nuse by partisans.  They were essentially well-made zipguns, incapable of\\neffective fire beyond a few feet.  But they were useful as a means of\\nkilling German soldiers for their guns.\\n\\nAlso note that the crowd-pleasin\\' favorite, the Sten gun, was\\nspecifically designed to require as little machine work as possible.\\nThe point\\'s been made here that one could make a Sten clone with steel\\ntubing, hand tools and a welder.\\n\\nI still think that while the point is good, I think there\\'s a difference\\nbetween marijuana and firearms, in that quality marijuana can be grown\\nlocally; there\\'s no need to import the stuff.  If guns are banned, I\\nthink the demand for \"real\" guns will be sufficient to make smuggling\\neconomically feasible, thus rendering a ban moot.

I don't have any record\\nbooks at college for me to check on though.  Please let me know, okay, if I \\nam wrong.  \\n\\tOnto the Padres.  Is there anyone out there who follows them?- especial-ly those with access to local news?  I don't here anything in Los Angeles and I\\ncan't get McPaper consistently around here.  \\ncomment:  It looks as though San Diego has gotten the better of the two deals\\nthat brought Bell and Plantier to the Padres.  It has also forced the team to use Darrell Shermann.  Of course, Plantier could get injured again or he could \\nhit with the power of 91 but with a lower average.  Bell always could finish\\nwith .240 and 15-18 hrs-essentially Jerald Clark's numbers.  \\nleadoff comment:  Craig Shipley??????  I get on base 29% of the time if I'm \\nlucky at leadoff?  Hell, of the usual starters, use Gwynn.  He's got 4 steals\\nalready.  Is Shipley starting because of an injury to Stillwell, though?  I\\nhaven't seen Stillwell's name in any box scores.  Anyway unless you are going\\nto use Shermann at leadoff then use Gwynn.  He at lesat gets on base and this\\nyear is stealing bases.\\nSheffield comment:  Though the season is early and stats mean nothing.\\nWitness Phillips batting .500+ currently.  But does Sheffield have an injury,\\nor anythingelse wrong with him.  I just don't hear anything.\\nAndy Benes:  Is he pitching like he did in the second half of '91?   or is \\nthis a flash of promise that he throws out evrey now and then?   Has anyone \\nseen him pitch the two good games?\\nscore for today, Sunday april 18:  Padres 10, St Louis 6.  Padres sweep the\\nCardinals as Gwynn goes 5 for 5 with a homer.

Anyone knowledgeable in the nuances of cryptographic development and research must understand that a key step in the development of a new algorithm, especially one destined for standardization, is the full disclosure of the algorithm to the private and academic sectors.  The proper evaluation of an algorithm dep\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nends on careful scrutiny by these sectors, and only such scrutiny can provide true public confidence in the security of the algorithm.  The assumption that a new algorithm will be accepted based on assurances from \"experts\" without full disclosure is plain ignorance.\\n \\nIn addition, the assumption that an algorithm will be marketable over other technology, such as DES, when it is characterized by key escrow is lunacy.  It seems an easy step in the logic chain that probable consumers will prefer to purchase equipment not crippled by government key escrow, no matter how \"tamper proof\" the key escrows might be.\\n \\nI cannot believe that even the least educated policy maker would have failed to realize these flaws.  I can only assume then that the drafters of the \"Clipper Chip Proposal\" knew very well the difficulties of selling a crippled system to the private sector.  The only way this proposal makes any sense, or has any chance of succeeding is in coercion.  Even the language of the proposal makes it painfully clear that the next logical step is the outlawing of other encryption devices and hardware that do not uti\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nlize the \"Big Brother Chip.\"\\n \\nUnfortunately the public at large is not educated enough on the issue to realize what they are losing.  I expect the Big Brother proposal to encounter little resistance from the American people who you will have so efficiently duped once again with pretty words like \"harmony,\" \"right to encryption,\" and \"voluntary.\"\\n \\nIt mortifies me that the phrase that seems to be used more and more often to characterize the Clinton administration is \"I can\\'t believe it\\'s happening here.\"  More startling is a question a colleague of mine posed and the realization that everyday it becomes more and more relevant; \"When is the Reichstag fire planned for?\"\\n \\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tMost Concerned,\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t[Signature]\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tShaen Logan Bernhardt I\\nuni@acs.bu.edu\\n',\n  'Eric H.

Many thanks for your\\nhelp.\",\n  '',\n  ': I would like to get your opinions on this: when exactly does an engaged\\n: couple become \"married\" in God\\'s eyes?  Some say that if the two have\\n: publically announced their plans to marry, have made their vows to God, and\\n: are unswervingly committed to one another (I realize this is a subjective\\n: qualifier) they are married/joined in God\\'s sight.\\n\\nThe way I read Scripture, a couple becomes married when they are *physically*\\nmarried, i.e. when they first have sexual intercourse.\\n\\ne.g. the end of Genesis 2 (quoted from memory) ``for this reason, a man shall\\nleave his parents and be joined to his wife, and they will become one flesh\\'\\'\\n(Jesus also quotes this scripture referring to marriage).\\n\\nIf you read through Genesis in particular, you will often come across the\\nphraseology: ``[man] lay with [woman], and she became his wife\\'\\'. This\\nimplies that she became his wife when they lay together, i.e. at the\\npoint of intercourse.\\n\\nCompare this with Jewish tradition: Joseph, when he heard that Mary\\nwas pregnant, had it in mind to divorce her quietly -- but Mary and Joseph were\\n*betrothed*, not married. i.e., they were in a binding relationship (which\\nrequired a divorce to get out of), but *marriage* would not occur until Mary\\nand Joseph went to bed together.\\n\\nCompare with Christ and the Church (Ephesians 5, Revelation 19): the church is\\ndescribed as the ``bride\\'\\' of Christ, but the *marriage* of the Lamb takes \\nplace when Jesus returns. i.e., we are in a binding love-relationship with\\nJesus, but we are still looking forward to the time when the marriage will\\ntake place. I see this as the spiritual equivalent of sexual intercourse,\\nbecause it represents the most intimate fellowship possible between man and God.\\n\\nIn summary, engagement should be honoured as a binding relationship, but it is\\nnot marriage. A civil ceremony is not marriage either. Marriage occurs at the\\npoint when the betrothed couple go to bed together. (I don\\'t mean to demean the\\ncivil or church ceremony -- ours was great! I don\\'t mean to be too pedantic.)\\nHistorically, I think I am correct in stating that the civil ceremony (i.e. a\\nmarriage recognised by the state), has only been around in the West since\\nNapoleon, who introduced it to keep tabs on the people (although I\\'m ready to be\\ncorrected on that point!)\\n\\nThis view obviously raises some questions:\\n\\nWhat about those who have had sex with one or more partners, without considering\\nmarriage. Are those people also ``married\\'\\'?\\n\\nIf it is true that marriage occurs at the point of intercourse, is it necessary\\nto be married in the eyes of the state? (I would say Yes, because this honours\\nthe laws of our nations in the West. Although it is not illegal to sleep\\ntogether though unmarried in most Western countries, I believe that it is God-\\nhonouring to proclaim our marriage to the state and to our friends before\\nactually consummating our marriage. Its to do with our being salt and light, and\\nalso to do with how people will perceive us; i.e. it is culturally insensitive\\nto declare yourself married without going through a civil ceremony.)\\n\\n-- \\n\\n-----\\nMichael Davis (cs89mcd@brunel.ac.uk)',\n  \"Can't guarantee that it'll work for everyone, but I finally fixed my mouse\\njumpiness problems: I installed a bus mouse.
